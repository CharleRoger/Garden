## Background

## First Totky-Feculky war

*Note: In this section, Feculky's and Totky's forces are also considered to include the forces of their allies, although they were not entirely coordinated.*

When the Totky-Feculky conflict began, the eventual victory of Totky was far from clear. Feculky, with their superior land-army, pushed up north, almost completely overwhelming Totky colonies there and forcing the Totky army to retreat with heavy losses. In the south, Feculky marched west with the remaining troops and took a defensive position against Totky's army in Kypky, along the coast bordered by mountains. However, Feculky was stretched rather thin, and with most of its military in the north, its southern areas were left weak. Realizing this, the king of Kypky took a daring gamble and circumvented the Feculky position through the mountains, leaving a portion of his army behind to mislead the Feculky commanders. Descending onto the coast, the king took Feculky's soldiers by surprise, flanking them and encircling them with help from his troops left behind. The battle proved disastrous for Feculky, leading to great losses and allowing Kypky to march to the capital (also called Feculky) with little resistance. 

In the north, Feculky was winning against Totky's forces from Taspi. However, once messages and requests for assistance reached them from the capital, a large portion of their forces retreated to the meet the Kypky threat. After waiting half a week for reinforcements, Totky was able to push through the remaining forces, mainly consisting of Feculky's allies, and advance towards the south, following in Feculky's footsteps.

In the meantime, Kypky had managed to take the capital Feculky, though with heavy losses. They had also managed to fortify their positions just in time before Feculky's northern forces arrived, but were facing issues with the civilian population and their own supply chain. Feculky's army gave something resembling a siege, wishing to prevent supplies from reaching from Kypky and trying several times to break into the capital. After around half a week of attempts, an opening was made in the northern portion of the city, and Feculky moved many of its troops there for the attack.

It was then that Totky's army arrived from the north, surprising both the king of Kypky and Feculky's forces. Through what might be described as sheer unfortune, Feculky's forces found themselves between Totky's southern army and the walls of the city held by Kypky. The ensuing confrontation was chaotic, with losses on both sides. The outcome was decided by Totky's successful rush to encircle Feculky's forces, using the ocean and the city walls for two of the sides. This manoueuvre would be later considered culturally significant, having cost the life of a Tot Cenukki leading the charge. With the encirclement in place, Kypky's army descended from the city to join their Taspian allies, causing widespread panic and the surrender of Feculky. This marked the end of the military conflict, and the start of a political one.
