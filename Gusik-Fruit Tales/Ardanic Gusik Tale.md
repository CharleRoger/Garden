# Introduction

What is the Gusik fruit tale? The Gusik fruit tale is supposed to be a multilingual story that can be used for comparing different languages, sort of like the North wind and the Sun or Schleicher's fable. 
Proper names can either be replaced or kept, adopting them to a given language might also reveal something regarding treatment of loanwords. The aim of the Gusik tale is to illustrate:

- Combinations of nouns and adnouns 
- Basic sentence structure (Verb + Subject, Verb + Object(s))
- At least two tense forms/variations
- Numbers and plurality
- Spatial relations 
- Possession of some kind 
- (Negation? Questions?)
- (Direct Speech?)
