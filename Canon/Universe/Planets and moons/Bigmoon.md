**Bigmoon** is the larger of the two [[Winter#Moons|moons of Winter]]. It is a large, bright, rocky body with an atmosphere.

The orbit of Bigmoon is in a temporarily stable equilibrium, which may become unstable via gravitational interactions with the other [[Solar system#Planets|planets of the solar system]]. If it were to become unstable, Bigmoon could be flung from the orbit of [[Winter]], disrupting the orbit of [[Smallmoon]] and [[Winter]] itself. Its position on the very edge of the largest possible orbit around [[Winter]], might indicate that it is a captured planet, but its similar composition suggests it formed along with [[Winter]].

It is in a 4:21 orbital resonance with [[Smallmoon]], and their synodic periods are coincidentally very close to a 3:19 ratio.
