**Smallmoon** is the smaller of the two [[Winter#Moons|moons of Winter]]. It is a small, dark, rocky body with no atmosphere.
# Observational characteristics
| Quantity           | Value                   |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Angular diameter   | 35.1 to 36.6 arcminutes |
| Apparent magnitude | -11.66 to -12.02        |
# Orbital characteristics
| Quantity                | Value           |
| ----------------------- | --------------- |
| Apoapsis                | 3.85625 × 10⁸ m |
| Periapsis               | 3.71053 × 10⁸ m |
| Semi-major axis         | 3.78339 × 10⁸ m |
| Eccentricity            | 0.01926         |
| Sidereal orbital period | 9.7392387 days  |
| Synodic orbital period  | 10.1310913 days |
| Argument of periapsis   | 221.938°        |

Smallmoon is in a stable orbit which is remarkably circular given the strong influence of [[Bigmoon]] on it. The two moons are in a 4:21 orbital resonance, and their synodic periods are coincidentally very close to a 3:19 ratio.

Unlike [[Winter]] and its other moon [[Bigmoon]], Smallmoon has a much higher and more usual density for a rocky body of this size. This suggests that the mechanism allowing the former two bodies to maintain such extraordinarily low densities is not present on Smallmoon, and perhaps indicates that Smallmoon formed separately.
