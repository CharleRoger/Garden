**Pharon** is the second [[Solar system#Planets|planet]] from the [[sun]] and the largest in the [[solar system]]. It is a gas giant with a mass more than 35 times that of all the other planets in the [[solar system]] combined, and slightly more than 1% the mass of the [[sun]].

## Resonance with other planets
Pharon's strong gravitational field has driven the major inner planets of the [[Solar system]], [[Scoria]], [[Rubroplano]] and [[Winter]], into an [[Solar system#Orbital resonance|orbital resonance]].

## Mass
Pharon's extremely high mass of 1.74442×10²⁸ kg is close to the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium, about 2.5×10²⁸ kg. In fact, it is probably not actually close to being a brown dwarf as it likely has a large rocky and metallic core, unlike a star which initiates fusion in a gas core.
