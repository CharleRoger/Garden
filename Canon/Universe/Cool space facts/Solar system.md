The **solar system** is the gravitationally bound system of the [[sun]] and the objects that orbit it.
# Planets
The largest eight objects orbiting the sun, which form a planetary system, are, in order of distance from the [[sun]]:
- the chthonian planet [[Narax]]
- the super gas giant [[Pharon]]
- the inner terrestrial planets:
	- [[Scoria]]
	- [[Rubroplano]]
	- [[Winter]]
- the gas giant [[Tünd]]
- the ice giant [[Gomb]]
- the large terrestrial ice planet [[Fleck]]
There are likely other astronomical objects orbiting the [[sun]], but these are the eight which are currently known; the seven which are visible from [[Winter]], and [[Winter]] itself. Note that [[Narax]] is often omitted in consideration of the six traditional planets, as its difficulty of observation has made it less apparent to the peoples of [[Winter]].
## Orbital resonance
The four major inner planets, [[Pharon]], [[Scoria]], [[Rubroplano]] and [[Winter]], orbit in a 1:3:4:8 resonance. The orbital periods of all seven planets are shown in the table below, which demonstrates this resonance:

| Planet     | Period (days) | Period (as a fraction of Pharon's) |
| ---------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Pharon     | 31.3183       | 1                                  |
| Scoria     | 94.2125       | 3.00823                            |
| Rubroplano | 125.6803      | 4.01300                            |
| Winter     | 251.8016      | 8.04001                            |
| Tünd       | 2149.9624     | 68.6488                            |
| Gomb       | 5267.5137     | 168.193                            |
| Fleck      | 17565.1230    | 560.858                            |

The resonance is driven by the strong gravitational effect of the massive [[Pharon]], which drives the motion of the entire inner solar system.
# Comets
Comets are small solar system bodies typically only a few kilometres across, composed largely of volatile ices. They have highly eccentric orbits, generally a periapsis within the orbits of the inner planets and an apoapsis far beyond [[Fleck]]. When a comet enters the inner solar system, its proximity to the [[sun]] causes its icy surface to sublimate and ionise, creating a coma: a long tail of gas and dust often visible to the naked eye.

Visible comets are fairly common in [[Winter|Winter's]] sky, with one typically appearing every couple of years or so. Most comets are seen only once, but some comets return to the sky periodically over hundreds of years. The largest and brightest period comet is the [[Big Green Comet]], which enters the inner solar system and becomes visible every 700 years or so.
# Location
The [[sun]] and solar system are situated 126 light years from the centre of a globular cluster known as [[The Glob|the Glob]] which appears to be extragalactic, i.e. it is not inside a host galaxy, though nothing is known of the universe outside the cluster.
