The **Big Green Comet**  is a particularly exceptional comet which appears in [[Winter|Winter's]] sky every ~700 [[Winter#Length of the year|years]]. This comet is bright green and remains visible in the night sky for almost half a [[Winter#Length of the year|year]]. For most of this time it looks much like any other comet and has an angular size of a few degrees, but gets larger as it moves towards periapsis. The main part of the apparition lasts ~10-20 days. During this period, the tail of the comet stretches almost from one horizon to the other and illuminates the night in a green glow. At its brightest, the entire tail of the comet is visible in the day and the brightness of the coma (the bright core of the comet) rivals the [[Winter#Moons|moons]].
