**Narax** is the closest [[Solar system#Planets|planet]] to the [[sun]], orbiting at a distance of only 4.5x the [[Sun|sun's ]]radius. It is a large rocky planet with a very high mean density over 9,000 kg/m³, giving it a surface gravity of almost 3g. It has no atmosphere and is in fact likely a chthonian planet, the core of an old gas giant which formed early in the development of the [[solar system]] but gradually lost its atmosphere due to its close proximity to the [[sun]].
# Observational characteristics
| Quantity           | Value                  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Angular diameter   | 37.6 - 44.6 arcseconds |
| Apparent magnitude | ~-5 to -11.2           |

Despite being much smaller and darker than [[Pharon]], Narax can sometimes appear almost as bright due to its proximity to the [[sun]] and its own thermal glow. Under perfect conditions, it can just about be observed at sunrise or sunset with the naked eye, but the vast majority of the time it's impossible to distinguish from the brightness of the [[sun]]. Many populations on [[Winter]] which don't practise much astronomy have no knowledge of Narax.
# Orbital characteristics
| Quantity                | Value           |
| ----------------------- | --------------- |
| Apoapsis                | 2.53864 × 10⁹ m |
| Periapsis               | 2.53196 × 10⁹ m |
| Semi-major axis         | 2.53530 × 10⁹ m |
| Eccentricity            | 0.001316        |
| Sidereal orbital period | 0.919578 days   |
| Synodic orbital period  | 0.916232 days   |
| Argument of periapsis   | 11.186°         |

Narax is tidally-locked, meaning one side always faces the [[sun]] and it rotates on its axis with the same period as its orbit, around 22 hours.

The side of Narax that faces the [[sun]] is mostly molten rock which is over 2,000°C in places, while the night side, which has not seen sunlight in hundreds of millions or perhaps billions of years, is well below zero.
