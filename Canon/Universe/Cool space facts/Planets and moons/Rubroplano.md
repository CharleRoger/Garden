# Observational characteristics
| Quantity           | Value                   |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Angular diameter   | 15.6 to 98.6 arcseconds |
| Apparent magnitude | ~-3 to -5.66            |

Rubroplano is one of the most readily visible [[Solar system#Planets|planets]] in [[Winter|Winter's]] night sky, in which its distinctive red-orange hue can be quite apparent. It lies closer to the [[Sun]] than [[Winter]] and only appears within about 30° from the [[Sun]] in the sky, meaning it's most commonly seen just before sunrise and just after sunset. Sometimes it may be visible in broad daylight, particularly when [[Winter|Winter's]] slightly elliptical orbit brings the planets close together.

## Resonance with other planets
Rubroplano orbits in an [[Solar system#Orbital resonance|orbital resonance]] with the the other major inner planets, [[Pharon]], [[Scoria]] and [[Winter]].

Rubroplano's atmosphere is thought to be composed of 75% nitrogen, 20% carbon dioxide and 5% argon, at a pressure of 89 atmospheres at the surface.
# Moons
Rubroplano has one tidally-locked moon, [[Yasi]], a small rocky body in a tight 19 hour orbit.
