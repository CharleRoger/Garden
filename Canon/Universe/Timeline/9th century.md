The **9th century** is the period from 800 to 899 [[Universal calendar|AGS]]. This century saw great shifts of power throughout [[Fountainhead]], with the end of powerful states such as the [[Yarlaganda Empire]] and the [[Telehe Empire]] and the flourishing growth of the [[Ansang Empire]] and [[Lavondu|Lavondu culture]]. These shifts led to an increase in cultural contact between previously isolated regions of the continent.
