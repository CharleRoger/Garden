The **1st century** was the century spanning the [[year 0]] to 99 [[AGS]]. It is often written as the **1st century [[Universal calendar|AGS]]** to distinguish it from the 1st century [[Universal calendar|BGS]] which preceded it. During this period, cross-cultural contact increased almost universally, establishing many important tribes and nations. Heightened trade led to the spread of writing independently in two different parts of the world: The [[Söwita̋néÿ]] script in [[K'tlagn]] and the [[Ugugo]] in [[T'ugü]].
