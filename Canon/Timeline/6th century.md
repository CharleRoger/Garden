The **6th century** is the period from 500 to 599 AGS. This century began with the expansion of the newly established [[Telehe Empire]] in [[Kóty]], which continued to expand and remained the dominant political power for several centuries thereafter. In [[Oksandanderi]], the [[Walken Empire|Walkenian]] invasions of the lowlands prompted the formation of the [[Yarlaganda Empire]]. It was also a formative period for [[Maicqa]] society.
