The **Ugugo** ([[Xiri]] [uˈŋuŋo~ʊˈŋuŋɔ]) is the script or family of scripts used to write the [[Xiri]] language and various other related languages native to [[Udovuʼo]].
# Name
The name *ugu-go* is an intensified collective plural derived from *ko* "cut", thus literally means "very many cuts". This name was coined in [[2nd century BGS]] in reference to the newly standardised syllabary, but has also been used generally to refer to all variants and earlier versions of the script.
# Signs and orthography
The Ugugo in its standard form is an irregular syllabary, in which the five signs for each consonant representing /Ca Ce Ci Co Cu/ are transparently related, but not via the addition of regular vowel marks as one would expect in an abugida. The forms of the 85 syllable signs attested in texts from the [[Garden palace]] on [[Erido]] in the [[1st century]] are shown below:
![[ugugo short syllables.png]]

Some texts from this corpus exhibit the use of an additional stroke to mark a long vowel. Though this practice was relatively rare, long forms of each of the 85 syllables are also attested at least once:

Coda glides /j/ and /w/ are transcribed ⟨Yi⟩ and ⟨Wo⟩ respectively, while /Cj/ and /Cw/ clusters are rendered as ⟨Ci-YV⟩ and ⟨Cu-WV⟩ respectively.

Coda fricatives /f/ and /s/ were originally written as ⟨Fu⟩ and ⟨Su⟩ respectively, reflecting an early pattern in which the vowels \*u and \*ə (perhaps [ɨ]) were both written with the same vowel mark, before \*ə was lost in this environment and shifted to /e/ elsewhere. Standard Ugugo as defined in the [[1st century BGS]] used ⟨Fa⟩ and ⟨Sa⟩ instead, though the earlier spellings can still be found as late as the [[2nd century|2nd century AGS]].

Coda nasals /m/ and /ŋ/ were similarly written ⟨Ma⟩ and ⟨Ńa⟩ in standard Ugugo, while coda /n/, which had been lost in the [[Erido]] dialect but leaving nasalisation on the vowel, was marked with a dot above the syllable sign. In the [[1st century]] or perhaps beginning even earlier, /m/ and /ŋ/ were similarly lost leaving a nasalised vowel, and so these words also came to be spelt with the dot mark. This convention continued into the script of [[Möxali]], the [[Opsíbdañox]], where it became a sign called *kivane* "hanger" which transcribed coda /n/.

Note that while the romanisation of [[Xiri]] represents intervocalic consonant allophones explicitly (*p t k f s x c rh* → *b d g v z ž j r*), the Ugugo itself never made this distinction, though such voicing marks do appear in descended scripts such as the [[Opsíbdañox]].

# History
![[evolution of the ugugo.png]]
## Origin and evolution
The history of [[Xiyeru]] writing begins some time before 4000 BGS with their [[Ńaʼay|tattoo tradition]], though true writing was not developed until much later. Pictographic representations of a person's characteristic attributes and important events in their life were incorporated into tattoos.

The earliest surviving pictographs are from around 3000 BGS, when people began to carve them into rocks to mark places of interest and commemorate important events. These pictographs bear no particular resemblance in form or function to any found in continental [[Fountainhead]], indicating that they were probably developed independently in [[Udovuʼo]], though similar tattoo traditions can be found in the islands of [[Buhō]], [[uSasa-Uhō]] and [[Ō-Hilau]].

Over the next few millennia, the pictographs became the primary unit from which tattoos were constructed and their use in other contexts dwindled as they came to solely reflect their use in tattoos. The word [[ńaʼay]] "marking" was used to describe the function of the individual symbols as well as the tattoo and act of tattooing as a whole. Every village had a few [[ńaʼayeru]] "marking-people", tattoo artists and scholars who are responsible for maintaining and sharing the knowledge of the tattoo. Since spoken personal names were directly derived from a person's tattoo, the symbols composing the [[ńaʼay]] came to be associated with the words of the name. Ritual writing began around 1500 BGS, where the tattoo-names of deities and past [[Āeruweʼa]] were written on bones and wooden figures which were then burnt. Names of "ordinary" people may also have be written similarly at coming of age celebrations or funerals.

This was still not quite a full system of writing, just a way to construct written representations of a tattoo-name which could only be recognised by a reader who already knew the spoken name and/or tattoo. There was no set syntax or grammar or way of writing much else beyond names, the symbols were freely combined and altered to express new meanings and there were many ways of presenting the symbols within the tattoo.

By 800 BGS, the structure of names had become so strongly intertwined with the [[ńa’ay]] that glyphs became attached to specific morphemes, and on [[Erido]] they were occasionally being used phonetically in writing. This went mostly unnoticed until about 700 BGS, when the Ugugo, a fully phonological script, was suddenly created and spread throughout [[Udovuʼo]]. The [[Xiyeru|Xiyeru's]] own oral history tells the story of the invention of writing by the semi-legendary figure [[Savamāri]] in 729 BGS. The earliest texts are accounts of the lives of contemporary and recently deceased [[Āeruweʼa]], and this is generally recognised as a key motivation for the original development of writing.

The first iteration of the Ugugo was an abjad consisting of 16 letters representing [[Proto-Xiri language|Proto-Xiri's]] inventory of 17 consonants, with a single letter for both \*n and \*ñ. This may have been deliberate since square numbers are associated with purity while primes signify disorder in [[Xiyeru|Xiyeru culture]]. When \*q merged with \*ʼ between vowels and \*k elsewhere, the letter ⟨Q⟩ dropped out of use, and a new letter was derived from ⟨N⟩ in order to uniquely represent ⟨Ñ⟩, maintaining the number of letters at 16.

The abjad was used to transcribe parts of speech not covered by [[ńa’ay]], like grammatical inflection, onomatopoeia and words which didn't have an established [[ńa’ay]]. The letters were used in conjunction with [[ńa’ay]] glyphs which would typically transcribe roots, though special glyphs existed to represent some complex words or aphorisms. This system of writing was much more rigid than the composition of tattoos, the graphemes were written in left-to-right rows in their spoken order. The [[Nejinayon|Fana’ayo Mū’oyo]] oral history was augmented with the use of Ugugo in the ritual reproduction of historical texts on leaves.

Most [[ńa’ay]] were easily recognisable and understood by everyone, but learning to write using them required years of practice. Ugugo on the other hand was incredibly simple and could be effectively taught to anyone in a matter of days. This led to the use of pure Ugugo to write all parts of speech phonetically, and subsequently the abjad developed into a variety of abugidas around the islands of [[Udovuʼo]] via the addition of semi-regular vowel marks, and remained a pure abjad in some usages, particularly in [[Azodo]].
## Standardisation
In the late [[2nd century BGS]], a standardised, though irregular syllabary was promoted by the [[Āeruweʼa]], which became the standard form of the script for several centuries. Non-standard varieties continued to be used in local traditions.

In the original standard Ugugo, there were no distinct vowel-onset signs, since it was based on an abjad which simply did not write syllables with no onset consonant. Due to the occurrence of the widespread \*p \*f \*h → /f h ∅/ chain shift originating in the prestige dialect of [[Erido]] in the [[3rd century BGS|3rd]] or [[4th century BGS]] and the continued promotion of standardised orthography, ⟨PV FV HV⟩ signs at the start of words came to correspond to /fV hV V/ respectively in speech. In fact, original \*h was lost completely in all environments in the [[Erido]] dialect, leaving only /h/ in word-initial position from original \*f. This prompted two spelling reforms in the [[1st century BGS]]:
- First, ⟨HV⟩ signs were removed from use in word-initial position in favour of a diacritic underline placed on ⟨FV⟩ signs (usually spelling /hV/), which indicated that the consonant was not to be pronounced.
- The spelling of these initial syllables was then regularised, so that /f- h-/ (← \*p \*f) were now spelt ⟨FV HV⟩ respectively, rather than the original ⟨PV FV⟩.
This left the vowel-onset signs unusually derived from the ⟨FV⟩ signs.

The Ugugo underwent further minor reforms throughout history, and was properly re-standardised in 623 AGS by [[Rhamari Fīkwaziguma Āeruweʼa]], one of her first official acts as [[Āeruweʼa]]. This was the final form of the Ugugo used to write the standard [[Erido]] dialect of [[Xiri]], which remained in use as a liturgical language in some niche religious practices well into the [[Xiyeru Confederation]].
## Spread to T'ugü
The standard Ugugo, along with some non-standard variations, were introduced to [[T'ugü]] in the [[1st century|1st]] or [[2nd century]], where they developed into a script for the [[Low Alöbi]] language, the [[Öbic Ugugo]], and later [[Opsíbdañox]] ([[Möxali]] script) and [[Eubli script]].
## Use in Azodo and the Xiyeru Confederation
In [[Azodo]], the standard Ugugo was scant and was never adapted to write the unique features in the [[Ahōtoli|Ahōtoli language]]. Early attitudes towards writing on the island were unfavourable at best and quite hostile at worst, with many people even considering the concept of recording the sounds of speech to be vulgar. Culture in [[Azodo]] had historically been more isolationist than the other islands, and when the standard [[Erido]] dialect of [[Xiri]] first began to spread to [[Azodo]], children were often discouraged from speaking with the labial consonants /m p f/ (which [[Ahōtoli]] conspicuously lacks) outside of specific situations which required the use of the [[Xiri|Xiri language]]. [[Xiri|Xiri's]] most common consonant /f/ was considered particularly obnoxious to many people, perhaps owing to its abundant use as a grammatical prefix on verbs which was not present in [[Ahōtoli]]. The [[Hawenewīneʼă]] "cultivation of proper speech", a [[5th century]] [[Ahōtoli]] text outlining the differences between the language and standard [[Xiri]], calls the ⟨F-⟩ glyphs of the Ugugo script
> *as pointless as they are loathsome*

and describes [[Xiri|Xiri's]] /f/ as
> *a wholly useless sound which may carry no meaning, and whose use signifies witlessness and a lack of self-cognisance*

When writing did eventually take hold, [[Azodo]] scribes preferred to continue the older abjad tradition without vowel marking. For centuries, the Ugugo was seen as an unwelcome digression from the [[Nejinayon|historical tradition]] for which it was primarily developed, which had survived just fine as a purely oral practice for millennia already.

The Ugugo was not used by the [[Xiyeru Confederation]] officially, and in fact writing didn't see much use by the state itself for a long time, the constitution for example was famously unwritten for the entire history of the state.

Through the [[8th century|8th]] and [[9th century|9th]] centuries, the Ugugo gradually fell out of use. In its place, the government began to use a deliberately invented logographic system directly based on the newly rigorised [[ńaʼay]]. Writing was mostly used for simplistic, yet unambiguous, official documents such as tax records and immigration papers, and thus was mostly concerned with recording the names of people and places, as well as numerals and dates. The [[ńaʼay]] was already a capable system of writing, in a sense, the only new development was the medium of paper in addition to living human skin. The system had the benefit of being mostly language-agnostic, essentially readable to speakers of the various dialects of [[Udovuʼo]] and later finding use among the [[Lavondu]] too.

[[Azodo|Azodo's]] variant of the abjad also continued to be used in conjunction with the logograms to disambiguate phonetic elements which couldn't be written easily with [[ńaʼay]] alone, though they were never used in actual tattoos. For example, the genitive suffix *-kī*, which was a common element in names, was written with a single consonant character ⟨K⟩. Some unique [[Ńuʼu#Standard system|kĭńuʼu]] names either lost their logographic spelling or never had any to begin with, a prominent example being the enigmatic mathematician [[Huxŭkală]], whose name has no known etymology and only the phonetic spelling ⟨HXKL⟩.
## Evolution
Shown below are some historical examples of inscriptions bearing the name of the creator of the world and the people in [[Xiyeru#Religion|Xiyeru mythology]], [[Fururūʼupwa]]. They were said to have had an infinitely large body covered with tattoos that depict the entirety of the universe's "creation, history and infinite trajectories". Their [[Ńuʼu|ūžańuʼu]] "full-name" is therefore also infinitely long and essentially just a description of everything that has ever happened and can possibly ever happen, so they're known by the epithet [[Fururūʼupwa]] for short. The name breaks down as *furu-rūʼu-pwa* "hand.make-sea-land", meaning "who makes the sea and the land". It is easily the most written name in [[Xiyeru]] history, hence the choice for this presentation.

![[history of fururūʼupwa.png]]
>1. (Petroglyph, ~3000 BGS)
A depiction of the creation of the land, sea, first woman and first man. This is the earliest known inscription that can be associated with a name (though it didn't represent one at the time), since it depicts the hands, land and sea glyphs which would later form the basis of the name [[Fururūʼupwa]].
>2. (Soapstone carving, ~1200 BGS)
This representation of the name, with the sea in one hand and the land in another, is characteristic of the malleable nature of the [[ńaʼay]] around this time.
>3. (Cut into leaf, ~700 BGS)
A typical transcription of [[Proto-Xiri language|Proto-Xiri]] \*pululūʼupua using Ugugo to write the initial consonant P- and [[ńaʼay]] to write \*ulu-lūʼu-pua "hand-sea-land". This is the script that was said to have been created by [[Savamāri]], so is known as Savamāric Ugugo.
>4. (Cut into wood, ~700 BGS)
A fully phonological transcription of \*pululūʼupua as ⟨P-L-L-ʼ-P⟩, by a person who had learnt how to write with Ugugo but not [[ńaʼay]]. 
>5. (Cut into leaf, ~300 BGS)
A relatively early cursive variant of the abjad demonstrating loss of symmetry in most letters. Though the word-initial chain shift p > f > h > ∅ had likely already occurred, the initial consonant was still spelt with ⟨P⟩ here.
>6. (Dye on wood, ~0 AGS)
Canonical full-syllabary Ugugo with semi-regular vowel marking and length marks. The orthography had been regularised and standardised in the [[1st century BGS]], resulting in this transcription of [[Fururūʼupwa]] as ⟨Fu-Rhu-Rhū-ʼu-Pu-Wa⟩.
>7. (Clay tablet, ~200 AGS)
Representative of the earliest writing present in [[T'ugü]], though still transcribing [[Xiri]]. Long vowels had merged with their short versions by this time, hence *Fururuʼupwa* ⟨Fu-Rhu-Rhu-ʼu-Pu-Wa⟩.
>8. (Ink on paper, ~500 AGS)
The name as it was loaned into [[Low Alöbi]] as *Fululuquba* [ɸululuʔubɑ], transcribed ⟨HU-LU-LU-QU-BA⟩. [[Low Alöbi]] had no /ɸ/ when the Ugugo was first adopted by the [[Öb]] in the [[1st century]], developing later from a rounded allophone of /x/ and through contact with [[Xiri]]. This example shows the standard way /ɸ/ was transcribed in the [[Low Alöbi#Mature stage|mature stage of Low Alöbi]], with ⟨HU⟩, ⟨HO⟩ or ⟨HU-WV⟩ with unrounded vowels.
>9. (Ink on paper, 771 AGS)
An [[Azodo]]-style transcription using [[ńaʼay]] on an official state document. The encompassing border originated as a stylised Ugugo letter ⟨F⟩ (simply a circle), transcribing the agentive prefix *f-* which was extremely common at the start of names. By this time, the agentive prefixes were often clipped off, and in fact never occurred in [[Ahōtoli]], the prestige language of the period, but the border remained as standard in writing all names.
>10. (Ink on paper, 861 AGS)
From the [[Inbúja Nahan]] "Older Sibling Proclamation", the first large text composed by the [[Öb]] and written in the [[Opsíbdañox|Möxali script]]. It was commissioned by the [[Lavondu]] to be presented to the [[Āeruweʼa]] and the five [[Āʼiyoru|governors]] of [[Udovuʼo]] to declare their peaceful independence as a separate people and the [[Öb|Öb's]] acceptance of their settlement and coexistence in [[T'ugü]]. The text was written in [[Möxali]], [[Low Alöbi]] and [[Xiri]] and mostly describes the consolidation of [[Xiyeru]] and [[Öb mythology]] and cosmology. The example presented is the [[Möxali]] form of the name, *Fluʼupo*, transcribed ⟨FA-LU-U-PO⟩
