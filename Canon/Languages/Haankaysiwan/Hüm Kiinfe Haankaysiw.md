**Hüm Kiinfe Haankaysiw** (*Haankaysiwan:*`[çyɲ‿ˈciːmβe ˈxɑːŋgai̯ʃiu̯]`), also known as just **Hüm Kiinfe** or **Haankaysiwan** is a cluster of dialects spoken on the [[Haankay Steppe]] by [[the Haankaysiw people]]. It is a lightly agglutinative language featuring front-back vowel harmony, mora timing, and a VOS word order as well as a consonant inventory on the smaller side and length distinction in vowels. It is a Nominative-Accusative language featuring a singular definite and plural definite article. 
# Phonology
Across all of its dialects, Hüm Kiinfe varies greatly in phonetics and phonology with minimal impact to mutual communication. This overview is therefore written in Standard Haankaysiwan, also known as Steppe Haankaysiwan, a potentially extinct dialect of Hüm Kiinfe.

## Allophony and Syllable Structure
The syllable structure of Haankaysiwan is \(C\)V\(C\). All vowels can be long, and semivowels cannot be in the coda of syllables with a long vowel. Vowel hiatus is not allowed.
- Before front-close vowels, /t͡s/ and /s/ are realized as post-alveolar [t͡ʃ] and [ʃ], and /k/ and /x/ are realized as palatal [c] and [ç].
- Nasals in coda assimilate, including over word boundaries. Before velar realized consonants and utterance final, they assimilate to [ŋ], before palatal realized consonants they assimilate to [ɲ], before alveolar and post-alveolar realized consonants they assimilate to [n], and before labials they assimilate to [m].
- The velar fricative /x/ is realized as [h] before non-velar consonants.
- The realization of the dorsal liquids /r/ and /j/ vary greatly between dialects. The most popular realization, however, is the alveolar tap [ɾ] and the palatal approximant [j] respectively.
- Voiceless consonants voice after nasals and when touching the voiced labial fricative /β/, but not across word boundaries.
- The open vowel /a/ is realized as [ɑ] after guttural consonants unless before the palatal liquid /j/ when the palatal liquid /j/ is in the coda.
- When the semivowel liquids /w/ and /j/ are in the coda and not intervocalic, they diphthongize with the nucleus vowel and are realized as [u̯] and [i̯] respectively.
## Mora-Timing and Stress
Hüm Kiinfe Haankaysiw is a mora-timed language. Syllabically, the mora break down as such:

- (C)V = Light
- (C)VV, (C)VC = Heavy
- (C)VVC = Super Heavy

If there is a super heavy syllable in a word, stress will fall on the first super heavy syllable in a word. If there is a heavy syllable in a word, stress will fall on the first heavy syllable in a word. Otherwise, stress will fall on the first syllable in a word with an onset.

Articles, Particles, and Affixes cannot be stressed and do not affect stress, however reduplication, including noun number, and derivation do. Monosyllabic words are stressed.
## Vowel Harmony
Hüm Kiinfe Haankaysiw features a front-back vowel harmony system, with the vowels /a/ and /e/ as transparent neutral vowels. When harmonizing, a vowel maintains its roundness. The front vowels are /i y ø/, and the back vowels are /ɯ u o/. If in a situation where the only trigger vowel for harmony in affixation is a neutral vowel, the realization of the affix’s vowel is that of a cardinal vowel (so /i/ for -I, /u/ for -U, and /o/ for -O).
## Canonical Root Shape
Roots can be any valid combination of up to two syllables and can be any part of speech (verb, noun, adverb), however they can only be one part of speech at a time. 

Adjective roots are extremely rare, and creating an adjective root is no longer productive; adjective roots are old and come from a time before zero-derivation between nouns and adjectives became the most productive manner of adjective-based derivation.
# Grammar and Syntax
## Word Order and Syntax
Hüm Kiinfe Haankaysiw has an underlying word order of VOS. It is an agglutinative language with isolating tendencies.

Hüm Kiinfe is head-initial and features prepositions. Adjectives, possessives, genitives, and relative clauses come after the noun. Demonstratives (including articles) and numerals come before the noun. Titles behave like adjectives.
# Articles
Hüm Kiinfe Haankaysiw features two articles, a singular definite, and a plural definite. The articles harmonize with the noun they are modifying.

|       | -   |     Singular      |      Plural       |
| ----: | --- | :---------------: | :---------------: |
|  Back | -   | ⟨hum⟩ /xum/ [xuŋ] | ⟨nïʻ⟩ /nɯʔ/ [nɯʔ] |
| Front | -   | ⟨hüm⟩ /xym/ [çyŋ] | ⟨niʻ⟩ /niʔ/ [niʔ] |
The singular definite article also acts as a Proper Article, and as such is used with names of people and major places, even if that would disagree with the plurality of the noun.

If a word ends with the same vowel as the suffix starts with and that vowel is short, the two vowels combine into one long vowel. Else, if the word ends in a vowel and the suffix starts in a vowel, a glottal stop is inserted between them

If the Comitative affixes on a word that ends in -/u/, it instead manifests as “-|ːʔI|”
### Particles
|ʔI| - Inalienable possession marker, placed in-between possesseé and possessor in this construction: “[possesseé] |ʔI| [possessor]”. The inalienable possession particle harmonizes with the possessor.
### Number
Hüm Kiinfe Haankaysiw features a way to mark plurality on the noun by reduplicating the rhyme before adding case markers. If the rhyme is only a short vowel, this surfaces as lengthening of the vowel, however if the rhyme is only a long vowel, a glottal stop is inserted between the end of the stem and the reduplication. Also, if the rhyme has a long vowel, the reduplicated element will have only a short vowel.
