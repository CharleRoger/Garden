### Noun classes

One of the most prominent features of Berkke its is noun classes system, dived into two classes, they display different declensions.

- Strong nouns: Nouns ending in consonants and /u/ and /i/.
- Weak nouns: Nouns ending in any vowel except /u/ and /i/.

They both differ in declension and agreement with the head verb. For weak nouns their final vowel is elided and then supplanted with the suffix vowel often changing qualities due to other vowels in the stem, practically changing the stem of the noun. For strong nouns they are practically unchanged, the only exception is with /u/ and /i/, these become semivowel.
