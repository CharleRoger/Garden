**Eubli** ([ˈøy̯bl̪ɪ], later [ˈybl̪ɪ]) is an [[Öbic languages|Öbic language]] and the primary language spoken by the [[Öb]] throughout most of [[T'ugü]] in the second millennium AGS.
# Name
The name *Eubli* simply means "[[Öb]]-language", which is essentially a remodelling of the word *[[Low Alöbi#Name|Alöbi]]*, which was a more archaic equivalent construction. Note that the Eubli word for "[[Öb]]" was *öb*, identical to the older [[Low Alöbi]] form, while *eub-* is an alternate form with vowel breaking triggered by the following close vowel *-i*, also seen in the ergative *eubi*.
# Development
Eubli represents the historical continuation of the [[Low Alöbi]] dialect cluster after centuries of contact and exchange, and often bilingualism, with [[Möxali]], while migrations carried [[High Alöbi]] from [[T'ugü]] out onto the [[Red Steppe]].

The sounds change which occurred during the development of Eubli from [[Low Alöbi#Transitional Alöbi|Transitional Alöbi]] are as follows:
- dʒ tʃ tʃʼ ʃ → dʑ tɕ tɕʼ ɕ / \_{i~ɪ, e~ɛ, y~ʏ, ø~œ}
- ɟ c cʼ ç → dʑ tɕ tɕʼ ɕ
	- Originally /dj tj tʼj xj/, introduced a phonemic distinction between palatal and post-alveolar consonants. Note that a few instances of [ɕ] already existed, originating from /sj/, with which /xj/ then merged.
- ej ew aj aw oj ow → ei̯ øy̯ aɛ̯ aɔ̯ ei̯ ou̯
- ɪ̃ ʊ̃ ɛ̃ ɔ̃ → ɪ ʊ ɛ ɔ
- ɪ ʏ ʊ → i y u / \_$
	- There was no phonemic distinction between [i y u] and [ɪ ʏ ʊ], found in open and closed syllables respectively, but this change is important in triggering the change below.
- e ø o → ei̯ øy̯ ou̯ / \_...{i, y, u}
- i y u → ɪ ʏ ʊ
	- This change is hard to position since it represents no structural change, but had completed before the 12th century, leaving /ɪ ʏ ʊ/ with little to no allophonic variation.
- e ø o → ɪ ʏ ʊ
	- This change, however, is a structural merger of /e ø o/ into /ɪ ʏ ʊ/ in open stressed syllables, leaving /ɛ œ ɔ/ in other syllables.
- wɪ wɛ wa → ʏ œ ɔ
	- Resulted in the loss of /w/ until it later re-emerged.
- a → ∅ / V(N)C\_#
- ŋ → ɲ / \_{ɪ, ɛ, ei̯, ʏ, œ, øy̯}
- ŋ → n / \_{a}
- x ʃ → h x
- ɸ s ɕ → β z ʑ / V_V
- ɸ β → h w
- dʒ tʃ tʃʼ→ dz̺ ts̺ ts̺ʼ
- d t tʼ z s → d̪ t̪ t̪ʼ z̪ s̪
- pʼ → p

From around the [[13th century|13th]] to [[15th century|15th]] centuries, further sound changes took place:
- ʔ → ∅ (optionally retained between vowels)
- z̪ s̪ → ð θ
- dz̺ ts̺ → z̺ s̺
- aɛ̯ aɔ̯ ei̯ øy̯ ou̯ → ɛ ɔ i y u
	- Note the merger of /aɛ̯ aɔ̯/ with /ɛ ɔ/ respectively.

# Phonology
Compared to [[Low Alöbi|Low Alöbi's]] 18 consonants and 7 vowels, Eubli features a greatly expanded inventory of 26 consonants and 12 (later 9) vowels, along with some slight phonetic shifts like dentalisation of the alveolars and *x h* [ʃ x] > [x h]. 
## Consonants
|                     | -   | Labial | Dental      | Alveolar      | Palatal    | Velar     | Glottal   |
| ------------------- | --- | ------ | ----------- | ------------- | ---------- | --------- | --------- |
| Nasal               | -   | *m*    | *n* [n̪\~n] | <             | *ň* [ɲ\~ŋ] | <         |           |
| Voiced obstruent    | -   | *b*    | *d* [d̪]    | *j* [dz̺\~z̺] | *ǰ* [dʑ]   |           |           |
| ^                   | -   |        | *z* [z̪\~ð] | ^             | *ž* [ʑ]    |           |           |
| Voiceless obstruent | -   | *p*    | *t* [t̪]    | *c* [ts̺\~s̺] | *č* [tɕ]   | *k*       | (*'* [ʔ]) |
| ^                   | -   |        | *s* [s̪\~θ] | ^             | *š* [ɕ]    | *x*       | *h*       |
| Ejective            | -   |        | *t'* [t̪ʼ]  | *c'* [ts̺ʼ]   | *č'* [tɕʼ] | *k'* [kʼ] |           |
| Approximant         | -   | *w*    | *l* [l̪\~l] | <             | *y* [j]    |           |           |
### Dorsal nasal
The dorsal nasal *ň* is normally palatal [ɲ], but is pronounced velar [ŋ] before the back rounded vowels *o u ou* and at the end of words.
### Sibilants
Eubli initially contrasted three sibilant articulations:
- Dentalised alveolar: *z s* /z̪ s̪/
- Apical alveolar: *j c c'* /dz̺ ts̺ ts̪ʼ/
- Palatal: *ǰ č č' ž š* /dʑ tɕ tɕʼ ʑ ɕ/

In later stages of the language, the dentalised alveolar fricatives *z s* came to be pronounced as dental fricatives /ð θ/, with the apical affricates *j c* shifting to fricatives /z̺ s̺/.
### Glottal stop
The glottal stop [ʔ] was originally a phonemically contrastive consonant in [[Low Alöbi]], but lost this status in Eubli. Though no longer pronounced, the glottal stop was retained in the native orthography as the letters ⟨QA QE⟩ in syllable-initial position, but not in coda position, as shown in the examples below:
- [[Low Alöbi]] *qayxil* [ʔɑjʃil → ʔajʃew] → Eubli *aežeu* ⟨QA-E-ŽE-U⟩ [aɛ̯ʑøy̯ → ɛʑy] "closed (as of eyes)"
- [[Low Alöbi]] *gayaq* [ɴɑˑjɑʔ → ɴajʔ] → Eubli *nae* ⟨NA-E⟩ [naɛ̯ → nɛ] "tattoo"

In some cases, ⟨QA QE⟩ served to separate vowels in hiatus, which before the [[15th century]] could still optionally be pronounced with an epenthetic glottal stop:
- [[Low Alöbi]] *naqem* [nɑˑʔem → nɑʔɛ̃ː] → Eubli *na'e* ⟨NA-QE⟩ [na(ʔ)ɛ → naɛ] "food" (c.f. *nae* ⟨NA-E⟩ [naɛ̯ → nɛ] "tattoo")
- [[Low Alöbi]] *leqic* [leˑʔitʃ → leʔɪtʃ] → Eubli *lei'ic* ⟨LE-I-QE.i-CA⟩ [lɛi̯(ʔ)ɪts̺ → lɛi̯s̺] "to want" (c.f. *eic* ⟨E-I-CA⟩ [ei̯ts̺ → is̺] "waterfowl")
## Vowels
### Early inventory
The late stage of [[Low Alöbi]] from which Eubli is descended, known as [[Low Alöbi#Transitional Alöbi|Transitional Alöbi]], contrasted three types of vowels: seven plain monophthongs each with a pair of tense and lax allophones, four nasalised monophthongs, and six diphthongs. The nasalised vowels /ɪ̃ ʊ̃ ɛ̃ ɔ̃/ merged with their unnasalised equivalents before the [[11th century|11th]] and thus are not recorded in the literary history of Eubli, resulting in seven phonemic monophthongs, shown in the table below.

|            | -   | Front unrounded | Front rounded | Central | Back    |
| ---------- | --- | --------------- | ------------- | ------- | ------- |
| Near-close | -   | *i* [ɪ]         | *ü* [ʏ]       |         | *u* [ʊ] |
| Open-mid   | -   | *e* [ɛ]         | *ö* [œ]       |         | *o* [ɔ] |
| Open       | -   |                 |               | *a* [a] |         |

[[Low Alöbi#Transitional Alöbi|Transitional Alöbi's]] six diphthongs were reduced to five with the merger of \*oy and \*ey, shown in the table below.

|  | - | Front unrounded | Front rounded | Back |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Close | - | *ei* [ei̯] | *eu* [øy̯] | *ou* [ou̯] |
| Open-mid | - | *ae* [aɛ̯] |  | *ao* [aɔ̯] |
### Later inventory
The diphthongs started to smooth into monophthongs in the [[14th century]], with the change fully progressed throughout [[T'ugü]] by the start of the [[16th century]]. At the same time, and perhaps interrelated with this monophthongisation, the open-mid vowels merged with the near-close set:
- *e ö o* [ɛ œ ɔ] → [ɪ ʏ ʊ] (merger with *i ü u*)
- *ae ao ei eu ou* [aɛ̯ aɔ̯ ei̯ øy̯ ou̯] → [ɛ ɔ i y u]

Note that the orthographic system of the language was standardised in the [[12th century]] under the [[Xiyeru Confederation]], thus the spelling of the old vowels remained:

| Phoneme | < | - | /a/ | /ɛ/ | /ɔ/ | /ɪ/ | /ʏ/ | /ʊ/ | /i/ | /y/ | /u/ |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Native spelling | Vowel-initial | - | A, QA | A-E, QA-E | A-O, QA-O | E, I, QE, QE.i | E.o, I.u, QE.o, QE.u | O, U, QA.o, QA.u | E-I, QE-I | E-U, QE-U | O-U |
| ^ | Consonant-initial | - | CA | CA-E | CA-O | CE, CE.i | CE.o, CE.u | CA.o, CA.u | CE-I | CE-U | CA-U |
| Romanisation | < | - | *a* | *ae* | *ao* | *i, e* | *ü, ö* | *u, o* | *ei* | *eu* | *ou* |
# Vocabulary
Eubli represents the evolution of [[Low Alöbi]] under the influence of [[Möxali]], which is itself a mixed language of [[Low Alöbi]] and [[Xiri]]. Though most common vocabulary is descended directly from [[Low Alöbi]] forms, many native [[Öbic languages|Öbic]] terms were replaced by words originating from [[Xiri]].
## Pronouns
The ergative and oblique cases of [[Low Alöbi]] pronouns merged into a singular relative case, used for a broad set of roles.

|  |  | - | Absolutive | Accusative | Relative |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| First person | Singular | - | *yade* | *idas* | *ineu* |
| ^ | Dual | - | *kade* | *kedas* | *keneu* |
| ^ | Plural | - | *fade* | *födas* | *föneu* |
| Second person | Singular | - | *yuz* | *yaz* | *yozou* |
| ^ | Dual | - | *kuz* | *kaz* | *kozou* |
| ^ | Plural | - | *fuz* | *faz* | *fuzou* |
## Numerals
Numerals have alternating forms depending on the initial segment of the classifier suffix, which is always present.
