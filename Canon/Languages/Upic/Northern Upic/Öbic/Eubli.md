**Eubli** ([ˈøy̯bl̪ɪ], later [ˈybl̪ɪ]) is an [[Öbic languages|Öbic language]] and the primary language spoken by the [[Öb]] throughout most of [[T'ugü]] in the second millennium AGS.
# Name
The name *Eubli* simply means "[[Öb]]-language", which is essentially a remodelling of the world *[[Low Alöbi#Name|Alöbi]]*, which was a more archaic equivalent construction. Note that the Eubli word for "[[Öb]]" was *öb*, identical to the older [[Low Alöbi]] form, while *eub-* is an alternate form with vowel breaking triggered by the following close vowel *-i*, also seen in the ergative *eubi*.
# Development
Eubli represents the historical continuation of the [[Low Alöbi]] dialect cluster after centuries of contact and exchange, and often bilingualism, with [[Möxali]], while migrations carried [[High Alöbi]] from [[T'ugü]] out onto the [[Red Steppe]].

The sounds changes which occurred during the development of Eubli from [[Low Alöbi#Transitional Alöbi|Transitional Alöbi]] are as follows:
- wɑ we wi → o ø y
- ŋ → ɲ / \_{i, e, y, ø}
- ŋ → n / \_{ɑ}
- nj dj tj tʼj sj → ɲ dʑ tɕ tɕʼ ɕ
- dʒ tʃ tʃʼ ʃ → dʑ tɕ tɕʼ ɕ / \_{i, e, y, ø}
- x → h
- ʃ → x
- ej ɑj oj ew ɑw ow → ei̯ äɛ̯ ei̯ øy̯ äɔ̯ ou̯
- f s ɕ → v z ʑ / V_V
- e ø o → ei̯ øy̯ ou̯ / \_...{i, y, u}
- i y u e ø o ɑ → ɪ ʏ ʊ ɛ œ ɔ ä
- ɪ̃ ʊ̃ ɛ̃ ɔ̃ → ɪ ʊ ɛ ɔ
- dʒ tʃ tʃʼ→ dz̺ ts̺ ts̺ʼ
- d t tʼ z s → d̪ t̪ t̪ʼ z̪ s̪
- pʼ → p
- ʔ → ∅ (optionally retained between vowels)

From around the [[13th century|13th]] to [[16th century|16th]] centuries, further sound changes took place:
- z̪ s̪ → ð θ
- dz̺ ts̺ → z̺ s̺
- ɛ œ ɔ → ɪ ʏ ʊ
- ei̯ äɛ̯ øy̯ äɔ̯ ou̯ → i ɛ y ɔ u
# Phonology
Compared to [[Low Alöbi|Low Alöbi's]] 18 consonants and 7 vowels, Eubli features a greatly expanded inventory of 27j consonants and 12 (later 9) vowels, along with some slight phonetic shifts like dentalisation of the alveolars and *x h* [ʃ x] > [x h]. In conjunction with the 
## Consonants

| Approximant | - | *w* | *l* [l̪\~l] | < | *y* [j] |  |  |
### Dorsal nasal
The dorsal nasal *ň* is normally palatal [ɲ], but is typically pronounced velar [ŋ] before the back rounded vowels *o u ou*.
### Sibilants
Eubli initially contrasted three sibilant articulations:
- Dentalised alveolar: *z s* /z̪ s̪/
- Apical alveolar: *j c c'* /dz̺ ts̺ ts̪ʼ/
- Palatal: *ǰ č č' ž š* /dʑ tɕ tɕʼ ʑ ɕ/

In later stages of the language, the dentalised alveolar fricatives *z s* came to be pronounced as dental fricatives /ð θ/, with the apical affricates *j c* shifting to fricatives /z̺ s̺/.
### Glottal stop
The glottal stop [ʔ] was originally a phonemically contrastive consonant in [[Low Alöbi]], but lost this status in Eubli. Though no longer pronounced, the glottal stop was retained in the native orthography as the letters ⟨QA QE⟩ in syllable-initial position, but not in coda position, as shown in the examples below:
- [[Low Alöbi]] *qelta* [ʔeltɑ → ʔeɫd̪ɐ] → Eubli *eud* ⟨QE-U-DA⟩ [øy̯d̪ → yd̪] "closed (as of eyes)"
- [[Low Alöbi]] *gayaq* [ɴɑjɑʔ → ɴɑjʔ] → Eubli *nae* ⟨NA-E⟩ [n̪äɛ̯ → n̪ɛ] "tattoo"

In some cases, ⟨QA QE⟩ served to separate vowels in hiatus, which before the [[15th century]] could still optionally be pronounced with an epenthetic glottal stop:
- [[Low Alöbi]] *naqem* [nɑʔem → n̪ɑʔɛ̃ː] → Eubli *na'e* ⟨NA-QE⟩ [n̪ä(ʔ)ɛ → n̪äɛ] "food" (c.f. *nae* ⟨NA-E⟩ [n̪äɛ̯ → n̪ɛ] "sleep")
- [[Low Alöbi]] *leqic* [leʔitʃ → l̪eʔɪtʃ] → Eubli *lei'ic* ⟨LE-I-QE.i-CA⟩ [l̪ɛi̯(ʔ)ɪts̺ → l̪ɛi̯s̺] "to want" (c.f. *eic* ⟨E-I-CA⟩ [ei̯ts̺ → is̺] "waterfowl")
## Vowels
### Early inventory
The late stage of [[Low Alöbi]] from which Eubli is descended, known as [[Low Alöbi#Transitional Alöbi|Transitional Alöbi]], contrasted three types of vowels: plain monophthongs, nasalised monophthongs and diphthongs. The nasalised vowels /ɪ̃ ʊ̃ ɛ̃ ɔ̃/ were not recorded in the majority of Eubli's literary history and merged with their unnasalised equivalents in the [[11th century|11th]] or [[12th century]], so are typically not canonically considered a feature of Eubli.

This leaves Eubli with seven phonemic monophthongs, shown in the table below.

|  | - | Front unrounded | Front rounded | Central | Back |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Near-close | - | *i* [ɪ] | *ü* [ʏ] |  | *u* [ʊ] |
| Open-mid | - | *e* [ɛ] | *ö* [œ] |  | *o* [ɔ] |
| Open | - |  |  | *a* [ä] |  |

[[Low Alöbi#Transitional Alöbi|Transitional Alöbi's]] six diphthongs were reduced to five with the merger of \*oy and \*ey, shown in the table below.

|  | - | Front unrounded | Front rounded | Back |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Close | - | *ei* [ei̯] | *eu* [øy̯] | *ou* [ou̯] |
| Open-mid | - | *ae* [äɛ̯] |  | *ao* [äɔ̯] |
### Later inventory
The diphthongs started to smooth into monophthongs in the [[14th century]], with the change fully progressed throughout [[T'ugü]] by the start of the [[16th century]]. At the same time, and perhaps interrelated with this monophthongisation, the open-mid vowels merged with the near-close set:
- *e ö o* [ɛ œ ɔ] → [ɪ ʏ ʊ] (merger with *i ü u*)
- *ae ao ei eu ou* [äɛ̯ äɔ̯ ei̯ øy̯ ou̯] → [ɛ ɔ i y u]

Note that the orthographic system of the language was standardised in the [[12th century]] under the [[Xiyeru Confederation]], thus the spelling of the old vowels remained:

| Phoneme | < | - | /ä/ | /ɛ/ | /ɔ/ | /ɪ/ | /ʏ/ | /ʊ/ | /i/ | /y/ | /u/ |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Native spelling | Vowel-initial | - | A, QA | A-E, QA-E | A-O, QA-O | E, I, QE, QE.i | E.o, I.u, QE.o, QE.u | O, U, QA.o, QA.u | E-I, QE-I | E-U, QE-U | O-U |
| ^ | Consonant-initial | - | CA | CA-E | CA-O | CE, CE.i | CE.o, CE.u | CA.o, CA.u | CE-I | CE-U | CA-U |
| Romanisation | < | - | *a* | *ae* | *ao* | *i, e* | *ü, ö* | *u, o* | *ei* | *eu* | *ou* |
# Vocabulary
Eubli represents the evolution of [[Low Alöbi]] under the influence of [[Möxali]], which is itself a mixed language of [[Low Alöbi]] and [[Xiri]]. Though most common vocabulary is descended directly from [[Low Alöbi]] forms, many native [[Öbic languages|Öbic]] terms were replaced by words originating from [[Xiri]].
## Pronouns
The ergative and oblique cases of [[Low Alöbi]] pronouns merged into a singular relative case, used for a broad set of roles.

|  |  | - | Absolutive | Accusative | Relative |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| First person | Singular | - | *yade* | *idas* | *ineu* |
| ^ | Dual | - | *kade* | *kedas* | *keneu* |
| ^ | Plural | - | *fade* | *födas* | *föneu* |
| Second person | Singular | - | *yuz* | *yaz* | *yozou* |
| ^ | Dual | - | *kuz* | *kaz* | *kozou* |
| ^ | Plural | - | *fuz* | *faz* | *fuzou* |
## Numerals
Numerals have alternating forms depending on the initial segment of the classifier suffix, which is always present.
