The **Proto-Öbic language** (**PÖb**) is the reconstructed common ancestor of the [[Öbic languages]], the native languages of [[T'ugü]].
# Phonology
Below are the reconstructed phonemes of Proto-Öbic.
## Consonants
|                  | -   | Labial | Alveolar | Post-alveolar | Velar | Uvular | Glottal |
| ---------------- | --- |:------:|:--------:|:-------------:|:-----:|:------:|:-------:|
| Nasal            | -   |  \*m   |   \*n    |               |       |        |         |
| Ejective plosive | -   |  \*p'  |   \*t'   |     \*c'      | \*k'  |  \*q'  |         |
| Plain plosive    | -   |  \*p   |   \*t    |      \*c      |  \*k  |  \*q   |   \*ʔ   |

The consonant inventory of Proto-Öbic is functionally identical to that of its ancestor [[Proto-Northern Upic language|Proto-Northern Upic]], with the only likely difference being the consonants \*c' \*c \*x having post-alveolar qualities [tʃʼ tʃ ʃ] rather than the older palatal [cçʼ cç ç] or [tɕʼ tɕ ɕ].
## Vowels
|       | -   | Front unrounded | Front rounded |  Back   |
| ----- | --- |:---------------:|:-------------:|:-------:|
| Close | -   |     \*i \*í     |    \*ü \*ű    | \*u \*ú |
| Open  | -   |                 |               | \*a \*á |

Similarly, there is no significant structural change to the vowels, with the only shift being a rounded vowel chain shift \*o \*ó → \*u \*ú → \*ü \*ű.
# Grammar
Proto-Öbic is an agglutinating language with an ergative morphosyntactic alignment. Content words can be categorised into three main classes distinguished by their valency:
- **Noun** — Zero-valency. A reference to an object or set of objects which can be marked for case and number.
- **Stative** — Monovalent. A state or quality, which can act as the predicate of a clause or as an adjunct to any other content word.
- **Verb** — Bivalent. An action, which can only appear as the predicate of a clause, marked to agree with the number of its subject. Though intrinsically bivalent, some verbs are semantically intransitive and thus never take an agent.
## Nouns
### Case
The old [[Upic languages|Upic]] case system began to die out in Proto-Öbic, with the only properly surviving case marker being the ergative *\*-in*, formed by the combination of the "relative" suffix *\*-i* and the "objective" suffix *\*-(a)n*. The absolutive case-marking use of the objective suffix was diminished in Proto-Öbic, where it became restricted to only possessed nouns, and the bare form of the relative suffix, which had previously marked some genitive-like adnominal case, eventually ceased to be used completely. Other than the ergative case marker, the relative and objective suffixes do survive in fossilised forms such as the name *alöbi* itself, from *al-öb-i* "tongue-Öb-ɢᴇɴ". Some other examples are shown below:
- [[Low Alöbi]] *cisk'on* "kingfisher sp." from [[Proto-Öbic language|Proto-Öbic]] *\*ci-sak'u-n* "red-beak-ᴘᴏꜱꜱᴅ"
- [[Low Alöbi]] *ititen* "centipede" from [[Proto-Öbic language|Proto-Öbic]] *\*it~it-an* "foot~ɪɴᴛꜱ-ᴘᴏꜱꜱᴅ"
- [[Low Alöbi]] *c'abüy* "tree bark" from [[Proto-Öbic language|Proto-Öbic]] *\*c'ap-ű-i* "skin/bark-wood-ɢᴇɴ"
- [[High Alöbi]] *q'aq'ogüme* "wagon-house" from [[Proto-Öbic language|Proto-Öbic]] *\*t'aq'ug-űm-i* "giant_snail-wooden_thing-GEN"

In addition to the two remaining case suffixes, an oblique case marker was innovated in Proto-Öbic from an unknown source, yielding a total of three grammatical cases:
- **Absolutive** *\*-∅* — The subject of a stative or the direct object of most verbs.
- **Oblique** *\*-(a)p* — Used in place of the absolutive to mark the direct object of certain "receiver" type verbs.
- **Ergative** *\*-in* — The agent of a transitive verb.

The Proto-Öbic case system was continued largely unchanged in both [[Low Alöbi]] and [[High Alöbi]].
### Animacy and number
Proto-Öbic features four grammatical numbers: singular, dual, paucal and plural. Number is optionally marked on a noun by a prefix whose form depended on which of three animacy categories the noun belongs to: human, animate or inanimate.

|          | -   | Human   | Animate | Inanimate |
| -------- | --- | ------- | ------- | --------- |
| Singular | -   | \*a-    | \*ti-   | \*yu-     |
| Dual     | -   | \*k(a)- | <       | \*xún-    |
| Paucal   | -   | \*má-   | \*pú-   | ^         |
| Plural   | -   | \*ni-   | \*xi-   | ^         |
