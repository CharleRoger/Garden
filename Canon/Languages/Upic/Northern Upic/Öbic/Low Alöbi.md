**Low Alöbi** is one of the two major dialect clusters comprising the [[Öbic languages]], the other being [[High Alöbi]].
# Name
The name *Alöbi* was likely formed long before the first attestation of the language in writing in the [[1st century]], evidenced by the use of the archaic genitive *-i*, yielding *al-öbi* "tongue of [[Öb]]".
# History
## Prehistory
Alöbi descends from [[Proto-Öbic language|Proto-Öbic]], a language brought to [[T'ugü]] by an unknown [[Upic peoples|Upic people]] some time around the 3rd - 1st millennia [[Universal calendar|BGS]]. This language diversified into perhaps several dialects in the 1st millennium [[Universal calendar|BGS]], with two primary groups of dialects having emerged by [[Universal calendar|year 0]], known as **[[High Alöbi|High]]** and **Low** Alöbi, which remained in contact for several subsequent centuries. Low Alöbi was the more populous group, spoken by the settled riverine populations of the lowlands, while [[High Alöbi|High dialects]] were spoken by semi-nomadic people scattered around [[T'ugü]].
## Early literate stage
The first writing in [[T'ugü]] appears towards the end of the [[1st century]], when writing, among other things, was brought to [[T'ugü]] by [[Xiyeru]] explorers. For the first few centuries [[Universal calendar|AGS]], writing was sparsely found, existing primarily as a trading utility.
## Mature stage
As trade and cultural contact increased, so did the spread of writing in [[T'ugü]] and the influence of the [[Xiri|Xiri language]] on Low Alöbi. The language is considered to have developed into its "mature" stage spoken c. 400 - 800 [[Universal calendar|AGS]] during the period of peak [[Xiyeru]] contact leading up to the [[Exodus period#The Great Sickness (655 AGS)|Great Sickness]], and the resulting influx of [[Xiyeru]] refugees to [[T'ugü]].

Low Alöbi underwent several phonological changes in this period, primarily motivated by Xiri influence, such as the intervocalic voicing of /t tʃ/ to [d dʒ], the nasalisation of vowels preceding coda nasal consonants, and the introduction of two new marginal phonemes /ɲ/ and /ɸ/, which were previously allophonic variants of /n/ and /x/ respectively.

The corpus of Alöbi literature is primarily from the latter centuries of this period, in which the orthographic diversity that had evolved in [[T'ugü]] was consolidated into standardised writing systems.
## Transitional Alöbi
The Low [[Öbic languages|Öbic language]] of the second millennium [[Universal calendar|AGS]] had diverged enough from Low Alöbi to be considered a historically distinct language, called [[Eubli]]. By convention, [[Eubli]] is taken to be historically separated from Low Alöbi via a transitional stage defined as the common spoken language of the [[Öb]] populace c. 700-1000 [[Universal calendar|AGS]]. This language stage, called Transitional Alöbi, also developed into various other minor languages and notably contributed to the Alöbi-[[Xiri]] mixed language [[Möxali]].

The precise form of Transitional Alöbi is uncertain since its deviation from the standard language was not recorded in writing until [[Eubli]] spelling reforms in the [[12th century|12th]] and [[13th century|13th]] centuries. Certain changes to the phonology, particularly of the vowel inventory, have been reconstructed, some examples of which are shown below (*Low Alöbi* → **Transitional Alöbi** → *Eubli*):
- Merger of word-final /ɑ e/ to \*ə:
	- *bit'e* [bitʼɛ] → **\*bit'ə** → *bit* [bitʼ] "egg"
	- *blixma* [bliʃmɐ] → **\*blixmə** → *blišma* [bliɕmə] "iridescent"
- Unstressed vowel loss between an approximant /w l j/ and an obstruent, likely first by shifting to \*ə:
	- *qayox* [ʔɑjɔʃ] → **\*qay(ə)x** → *aex* [äɛ̯x] "clear weather"
	- *owik*' [owɪkʼ] → **\*ow(ə)k'** → *ouk* [ou̯kʼ] "change"
- Vocalisation of coda /l/ to \*w:
	- *ibyal* [ibjɐɫ] → **\*ibyaw** → *ibyao* [ibjäɔ̯] "cross over, travel through"
	- *celcel* [tʃeɫdʒɛɫ] → **\*cewjew** → *čeuǰeu* [tɕøy̯dʑøy̯] "arrive"
- Loss of coda nasals, forming four nasalised vowels \*in (← iN), \*un (← uN, üN) , \*en (← eN), \*on (← aN, oN, öN):
	- *wilig* [wil̪ɪ̃(ŋ)] → **\*wilin** → *wili* [wil̪ɪ] "rod"
	- *gosum* [ŋosʊ̃(m)] → **\*gosun** → *gosu* [ŋosʊ] "sieve"
	- *höten* [ɸød̪ɛ̃(n̪)] → **\*föden** → *föde* [ɸød̪ɛ] "1PL"
	- *anta* [ɑ̃(n̪)d̪ɐ] → **\*ondə** → *od* [ɔd̪] "open (as of a flower)"
- Formation of six diphthongs (\*ey \*ay \*oy \*ew \*aw \*ow) from vowel + glide and vowel + vowel sequences (note that nasalised vowels were also subject to this merger):
	- *üyet*' [yjɛtʼ] → **\*eyt'** → *eit* [ei̯tʼ] "fear"
	- *aib* [ɑɪb] → **\*ayb** → *aeb* [äɛ̯b] "narrow gap"
	- *yuek* [juɛk] → **\*yoyk** → *yeik* [jei̯k] "scaly fish"
	- kihiw [kixɪw] → **\*kihew** → *kiheu* [kixøy̯] "inhale"
	- *laüm* [l̪ɑʏ̃(m)] → (\*laun → ) **\*law** → *lao* [l̪äɔ̯] "corner"
	- *xulab* [ʃul̪ɐb] → **\*xowb** → *xoub* [xou̯b] "wrap up"
# Phonology
## Consonants
|  | - | Labial | Alveolar | Post-alveolar | Dorsal | Glottal |
| ---- | ---- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Nasal | - | *m* | *n* | (*ny* [ɲ]) | *g* [ŋ~ɴ] |  |
| Ejective plosive | - | *p'* | *t'* | *c'* [tʃʼ] | *k'* [kʼ~qʼ] |  |
| Plain plosive | - | *b* | *t* (*d*) | *c* [tʃ] (*j* [dʒ]) | *k* [k~q] | *ʔ* |
| Fricative | - | (*f* [ɸ~f]) | *s* | *x* [ʃ] | *h* [x~χ] |  |
| Resonant | - | *w* | *l* | *y* [j] |  |  |
### Coronal consonants
The consonants *c c' x* are pronounced [tʃ tʃʼ ʃ] respectively, while the approximant *y* is palatal [j] but forms a natural group with the post-alveolars when considering phonotactics.

Some time in the 4th century, the consonants *t c* were voiced to [d dʒ] between two voiced segments, often romanised as *d j* in transcriptions of Low Alöbi from around 300 - 600 [[Universal calendar|AGS]].
### Dorsal consonants
The dorsal series *g k k' h* are uvularised to [ɴ q qʼ χ] next to *a* [ɑ] within the same syllable.
### Labial fricative
The labial fricative *f* did not exist natively in Alöbi, being introduced via Xiri loans during the [[2nd century|2nd]] and [[3rd century|3rd]] centuries. By 400 [[Universal calendar|AGS]], older instances of *hw* and *h* next to *u* and *ü* had merged into *f*, which at this time was bilabial [ɸ].
## Vowels
|  | - | Front unrounded | Front rounded | Back |
| ---- | ---- | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Close | - | *i* | *ü* | *u* |
| Mid | - | *e* | *ö* | *o* |
| Open | - |  |  | *a* |
Unstressed vowels are slightly centralised and, with the exception of *a*, more open than when stressed. A table of typical vowel qualities is shown below:

|  | - | a | e | ö | o | i | ü | u |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Stressed | - | ɑˑ | eˑ | øˑ | oˑ | iˑ | yˑ | uˑ |
| Unstressed | - | ɑ | ë̞~ə | ø̞̈ | ö̞ | ɪ | ʏ | ʊ |
### Diphthongs
In the [[8th century]], sequences of vowels and coda glides began to collapse into a system of six diphthongs, shown in the table below, laying the foundation for what would become the vowel system of the later [[Eubli]] language. This late stage of Low Alöbi is known as [[Low Alöbi#Transitional Alöbi|Transitional Alöbi]].

|  | - | _a-_ | _i-_ | _ö-_ | _ü-_ | _o-_ | _u-_ |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| _-y_ | - | ay | - | ey | - | oy | < |
| _-w_ | - | aw | ew | < | < | ow | - |
## Phonotactics
The syllable structure of Low Alöbi is (C)(A)V(C) where *C* is any consonant, *V* is any vowel and *A* is an approximant /w l j/. An approximant *A* can only occur if the onset consonant is a non-approximant with a different place of articulation to *A*. Syllables with no onset consonant are common and as a result, there are many examples of vowel hiatus. If two identical vowels meet at a syllable boundary, a glottal stop /ʔ/ is inserted between them. Every word has one stressed syllable which falls on the first syllable of the stem.
# Grammar
## Nouns
### Adverbial cases
Nouns inflect for three morphosyntactic cases which mark the role of a noun in a verb or stative phrase.
#### Absolutive
The unmarked case. Used for the sole argument of a stative phrase or the direct object of certain transitive verbs.
#### Ergative
The ergative case is marked with the suffix *-in*. This case is used for the agent of transitive verbs, which may be the sole argument if the verb phrase has no explicit object.
#### Oblique
The oblique case is marked with *-b* on vowel-final stems and *-eb* otherwise. Nouns in the oblique case are most commonly used in an accusative or dative role, as the direct object or "receiver" of a transitive verb. Some verbs take the absolutive, while others take the oblique case as their direct object. The oblique is also used for additional arguments to any verb, with the particular role specified with prepositions.
### Adnominal cases
### Grammatical number
A prefix can be optionally attached directly to a noun stem to specify grammatical number. All nouns still have a grammatical number even if not specified with a prefix, the number may be implied by context or verb inflection, or a default number is assumed depending on the noun. For example, animals and people are plural by default and so unspecified number is generally treated as plural. Things like the sun and the world are always singular, so never need to be marked as such.

A noun with a number prefix is said to have [[noun instancing|instanced]] reference to a specific, countable instance of a thing, regardless of definiteness, rather than generic reference to a kind or category. The instancing number prefixes of Alöbi are shown in the table below.

|  | - | People | Animate | Inanimate |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Singular | - | *(e)-* | *ti- / ty-* | *yo-* |
| Dual | - | *k(e)-* |  | *xun-* |
| Paucal | - | *ma-* | *bu-* |  |
| Plural | - | *ni- / ny-* | *x(i)-* |  |

Vowels in brackets are present only on obstruent-initial stems, so the singular person prefix is null on vowel and approximant-initial stems.

The dual number is used for a pair of complementary things, such as a married couple, a pair of shoes, or the [[Winter#Moons|two moons of Winter]], while the paucal number represents a generic set of around two to five things.
### Numerals
The numeral system of Low Alöbi is base-five, with the basic numeral roots from one to five; *ac-, wib-, nüh-, bix-* and *om-*.

Greater numbers are formed using a special suffix *-ö*, which turns an absolute numeral into an modifying numeral which adds its value to a following multiple of five.
> *acö om-, wibö om-, nühö om-, bixö om-*
> `ac -ö   om-,   wib-ö   om-,   nüh  -ö   om-,   bix -ö    om-`
> `one-ADD five,  two-ADD five,  three-ADD five,  four-ADD five`
> "six, seven, eight, nine"

Ten and twenty-five have their own roots, *üs-* and *myaq-* respectively. Other multiples of five are expressed using a mixture of twenty-fives, tens and fives using the relational linker suffix *-i*.

| Decimal | - | Alöbi numeral root | Gloss |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 10 | - | *üs-* | `ten` |
| 15 | - | *nüh-om-i-* | `three-five-LNK` |
| 20 | - | *wib-üs-i-* | `two-ten-LNK` |
| 25 | - | *myaq-* | `25` |
| 30 | - | *nüh-üs-i-* | `three-ten-LNK` |
| 35 | - | *üs-ö myaq-* | `ten-ADD 25` |
| 40 | - | *bix-üs-i-* | `four-ten-LNK` |
| 45 | - | *wib-üs-i-ö myaq-* | `two-ten-LNK-ADD 25` |
| 50 | - | *wib-myaq-i-* | `two-25-LNK` |
| 55 | - | *om-ö wib-myaq-i-* | `five-ADD two-25-LNK` |
| 60 | - | *üs-ö wib-myaq-i-* | `ten-ADD two-25-LNK` |
| 65 | - | *nüh-om-i-ö wib-myaq-i-* | `three-five-LNK-ADD two-25-LNK` |
| 125 | - | *om-myaq-i-* | `five-25-LNK` |
#### Classifiers
Numeral stems do not occur in isolation and must be suffixed with a classifier which specifies the type of object being counted. Animals are classified by type of animal and non-animal objects are generally classified by shape.

|Classifier|Noun class|
|---|---|
|_-ka_|**Öb people**: [[Öb]], as distinct from other humanoid peoples like the [[Xiyeru]], which the [[Öb]] came into contact with in the [[1st century]]. |
|_-tu_|**Non-Öb humans**|
|_-to_|**Large land animals which are strictly not eaten**: large ungulates, large birds, [[k'ak'oh]] |
|_-ag_|**Small land animals which can typically be eaten**: flightless birds, toads, some large crabs, [[k'übi]], [[sibig]] |
|_-c'i_|**Smaller animals which are not typically eaten, pests**: insects, small crustaceans, lizards, rodents, worms|
|_-iw_|**Flying birds**|
|_-sü_|**Fish**|
|_-wo_|**Hollow objects**: baskets, barrels, bags, houses, caves, some shells|
|_-en_|**Roundish objects that fit in the hand**: most fruit and vegetables, pieces of meat|
|_-tik'_|**Small clustering objects**: seeds, grains, pebbles, berries, eggs, stars|
|_-lam_|**Flat objects which can be stacked**: flatbreads, leaves, pieces of cloth|
|_-na_|**Slightly elongated objects**: fish (as food), certain fruit, dead bodies, knives, planks of wood|
|_-ig_|**Extremely elongated objects**: sticks, rods, bones|
|_-öx_|**Large, irregularly shaped objects**: boulders, clouds, mountains, villages, forests|
|_-luc_|**Objects with a branching structure**: trees, pieces of [[Cimcim#Ökya cimcim\|ökya cimcim]], lightning bolts |
|_-ö_|**Cyclic or reciprocal things**: months, years, wheels, transactions|
|_-ay_|**Objects with no physical form**: words, thoughts, colours, days, other non-physical things|
Two of the classifiers were innovated in the first few centuries [[Universal calendar|AGS]]:
- *-lu* ~ *-du* — Initially referring to Xiyeru people, derived from *elu* ~ *edu* [ˈelʊ ~ edʊ] "Xiyeru person" ← Xiri *eru* "person".
- *-ö* — Partially a back-formation from *omö* "major month (50 days)", rebracketed as `five-CLF`.

Numerals do not modify nouns but rather are nouns which can be modified by the thing being counted. The noun being counted is adjectivised by a genitive prefix *a-*, and falls last in the list of adjectives modifying the numeral noun.
> *owa ugo, augo bixto, owa augo bixto*
> `owa  ugo,  a-  ugo  bix -to,  owa  a-  ugo  bix -to`
> `big  ugo,  GEN-ugo  four-CLF  big  GEN-ugo  four-CLF`
> "big ugo, four ugo, four big ugo"

Context often permits the original noun to be dropped:
> *cia öb, cia wibka*
> `cia  öb,      cia  wib-ka`
> `red  person,  red  two-CLF`
> "red person, two red people"

Grammatical number is a strictly separate system to the numerals, which are in fact grammatically singular nouns by default and can therefore take number marking like any other noun. Typically counted things like days, animals and traded goods are often referred to by specific numeral constructions, some examples of which are shown below:
- *yo-ac-uk* (singular) — A single branch of a tree or cimcim.
- *k-om-lig* (dual) — A person's fingers, lit. a pair of five rod-shaped things.
- *xun-üs-ay* (plural) — One year or the calendar in general, lit. many tens of abstract counted things, alluding to its ten-day "weeks".
- *(e)-bix-ka* (singular) — A team of four people composed of an *iniwab* "coordinator" and three other specific distinct roles, a common structure used in hunting, construction and other small-scale collaborative efforts.

While [[Noun instancing|uninstanced]] nouns with no specified number are treated as plural by the pronominal and verb agreement systems, numeral nouns are treated as singular. For example, *ugo* is interpreted as an unspecified number of [[ugo]], whereas *a-ugo om-to* is interpreted as a single group of five [[ugo]].
#### -n-
A special numeral root, *-n-*, carries no value and serves as a dummy root for lexical derivation using classifiers. It always occurs as a coda nasal and is the only zero-syllabic root in the language. It assimilates to the following consonant like other underlying coda nasals, so can also manifest as any of [m~n~ŋ~ɴ], but is written *-n-* regardless.

Unlike other numeral roots, *-n-* is used very commonly to refer to all things, whether they are typically counted or not, and is commonly inflected with an instancing prefix. Some examples of words derived from *-n-* are shown below:
- *ti-n-sü* — A fish, typically as food.
- *ke-n-ka* — A pair of [[Öb]] who have formed a life bond similar to marriage.
- *bu-n-to* — A small group of large animals. In the context of trade, a *bunto* is a group of [[ugo]] consisting of one male and a few females.
- *xi-n-iw* — A generic plural group of flying birds, i.e. a flock.
### Pronouns
#### True pronouns
First and second person pronouns are "true" pronouns which represent the speaker and the addressee respectively. The true pronouns follow a nominative-accusative alignment, where the nominative case is used for transitive agents and stative subjects and the accusative is used as the direct object of verbs which would ordinarily take an absolutive noun.
> *yaten yasu banö*
> `yaten    yasu     banö`
> `1SG.NOM  2SG.ACC  see`
> "I see you"

Like the typical absolutive case, the nominative also has a genitive function when placed immediately before a noun.
> *yaten yomam*
> `yaten    yo=     (a)mam`
> `1SG.NOM  INAN.SG=house.ABS`
> "my house"

A dative case is used for the "recipient" role of verbs which would ordinarily take an oblique noun as direct object.
> *yaten yosol xunnaqem oltüm*
> `yaten    yosol    xun=    naqem  oltüm`
> `1SG.NOM  2SG.DAT  INAN.PL=food   give`
> "I give you some food"

Additional arguments to any verb take the oblique case with prepositions, like any other noun.
> *yaten lan yosiw yoxayay ibyal*
> `yaten    lan  yosiw    yo=     xayay      ibyal`
> `1SG.NOM  COM  2SG.OBL  INAN.SG=river.ABS  travel_through`
> "I cross the river with you"

A full table of true pronouns is shown in the table below.

|  | < | - | Nominative | Accusative | Dative | Oblique |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| First person | Singular | - | *yaten* | *itas* | *inel* | *iniw* |
| ^ | Dual | - | *katen* | *ketas* | *kenel* | *keniw* |
| ^ | Paucal | - | *maten* | *matas* | *manel* | *maniw* |
| ^ | Plural | - | *hwaten* | *hötas* | *hönel* | *höniw* |
| Second person | Singular | - | *yuso* | *yasu* | *yosol* | *yosiw* |
| ^ | Dual | - | *kuso* | *kasu* | *kosol* | *kosiw* |
| ^ | Paucal | - | *mawso* | *masu* | *mawsol* | *mawsiw* |
| ^ | Plural | - | *huso* | *hasu* | *husol* | *husiw* |

Additionally, possessive proclitics are sometimes used to express certain inalienable possessions. These clitics take different forms depending on whether they precede a vowel or a consonant, shown in the table below.

|  | - | Consonant | Vowel |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| First person | - | *ten-* | *n-* |
| Second person | - | *so-* | *s-* |
> *ninin inel tennoclo oltüm*
> `n=     inin     inel     ten=     noclo     oltüm`
> `1.POSS=2SG.DAT  1SG.DAT  1.POSS=  name.ABS  give`
> "My parents gave me my name"

> *tyacasin soktihac xulab*
> `ty-    acasin     so=    k(e)-  tihac    xulab`
> `2SG.AN=snake.ERG  2.POSS=DU-    leg.ABS  wrap_around`
> "A snake is wrapping around your legs"
#### Classifier pronouns
Alöbi has no true third person pronouns, instead using the dummy numeral _-n-_ described above which takes classifiers and grammatical number prefixes. For example, the table below shows the numeral-type third person "pronouns" commonly used for [[Öb]] and non-[[Öb]] people in the [[Exodus period]]:

|  | < | - | Absolutive | Ergative | Oblique |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Öb | Singular | - | *enka* | *enkin* | *enkab* |
| ^ | Dual | - | *kenka* | *kenkin* | *kenkab* |
| ^ | Paucal | - | *manka* | *mankin* | *mankab* |
| ^ | Plural | - | *ninka* | *ninkin* | *ninkab* |
| Non-Öb | Singular | - | *endu* | *endin* | *endub* |
| ^ | Dual | - | *kendu* | *kendin* | *kendub* |
| ^ | Paucal | - | *mandu* | *mandin* | *mandub* |
| ^ | Plural | - | *nindu* | *nindin* | *nindub* |
# Vocabulary
## Xiri loans
Low Alöbi loaned many words from [[Xiri]] when the speakers of the two languages began trading around the [[1st century|1st]] or [[2nd century|2nd]] century. Most of the borrowed vocabulary consists of material cultural terminology, some examples of which with the approximate pronunciations c. 400 [[Universal calendar|AGS]] are shown in the table below.

|Xiri|Alöbi|
|---|---|
|*eru* [ˈeɾʊ] "person, soul" |*elu* [ˈel̪ʊ] "Xiyeru person" |
|*kare* [ˈkaɾɛ̈] "demon, evil spirit" |*kale* [ˈkɑl̪ə] "malaise" |
|*iji* [ˈidʒɪ] "pig" |*ici* [ˈidʒɪ] "pig, k'übi" |
|*igi* [ˈiŋɪ] "milk" |*igi* [ˈiŋɪ] "milk" |
|*ene* [ˈen̪ɛ̈] "rice" |*ene* [ˈen̪ə] "rice" |
|*kwi* [kʷi] "yam" |*kükü* [ˈkykʏ] "yam" |
|*warań* [ˈwaɾə̃ː] "alcohol, yam wine" |*wadeg* [ˈwɑd̪ə̃ŋ] "yam wine" |
|*saža* [ˈsaʒə] "tea" |*sace* [ˈsɑdʒə] "tea" |
|*(fawēʼeya)žožada* [(fəˈweʔɛˌja)ʒɔˌʒad̪ə] "garlic" |*xocat* [ˈʃodʒɑt̪] "garlic" |
The ubiquitous [[Xiri]] transitive verb prefix *fa-* was carried into Low Alöbi as a derivational prefix *fo-* forming verbs from roots with the meaning "to enact or create [noun/state]". This prefix emerged just before [ɸ], previously a rounded allophone of *h*, became phonemic, and may have originally been loaned as *hwa-* [xʷɒ- ~ ɸɒ-]. Also around this time, the native [[Öbic languages|Öbic]] root + affix derivational pattern dropped out of use, fossilising disyllabic stems, so *fo-* may have been one of the last productive derivational prefixes. Some examples of *fo-* verbs with corresponding nouns using the same reanalysed root are shown in the table below.

|Xiri|Alöbi verb|Alöbi noun|
|---|---|---|
|*fańaʼay-* [fəˈŋaʔai̯-] "to tattoo, mark, stain" |*fogaq* [ˈɸoɴɑʔ] "to tattoo" |*gayaq* [ˈɴɑjɑʔ] "tattoo" |
|*faʼawa-* [fəˈawə-] "to stir, mix, jostle" |*foqaw* [ˈɸoʔɑw] "to mix" |*qawqaw* [ˈʔɑwʔɑw] "mixture" |
|*fańū-* [fəˈŋu-] "to love, like, enjoy" |*fogu* [ˈɸoŋʊ] "to enjoy" |*bagu* [ˈbɑŋʊ] "passion" |
|*faraʼe-* [fəˈɾaʔɛ̈-] "to burn, heat, cook" |*folaq* [ˈɸol̪ɑʔ] "to cook" |*laqem* [ˈl̪ɑʔə̃m] "(cooked) food" |

Some words appear to have been influenced by the grammar and vocabulary of [[Xiri]], though are not direct loans. Some examples of such words are shown in the table below, along with the original terms which were replaced or remodelled.

| Xiri                          | Remodelled Alöbi                                         | Original Alöbi                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
