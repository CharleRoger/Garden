**High Alöbi** is one of the two major dialect clusters comprising the [[Öbic languages]], the other being [[Low Alöbi]]. High Alöbi, spoken in the southern hills of [[T'ugü]], tends to be more phonologically conservative, but lexically more innovative, with many compound words replacing older vocabulary retained in [[Low Alöbi]].
# Name
 Like [[Low Alöbi]], the language is simply called "Alöbi" by its native speakers, which in High Alöbi is rendered as *alöpe* [ɑlʏpɪ]. (See: [[Low Alöbi#Name]]).
# Phonology
## Consonants
|  | - | Labial | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Uvular |
| ---- | ---- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Nasal | - | *m* | *n* |  |  |  |
| Ejective plosive | - | *p'* | *t'* | *c'* [tɕʼ] | *k'* [kʼ] | *q'* [qʼ] |
| Plain plosive | - | *p* | *t* | *c* [tɕ] | *k* [k] | *q* [q] |
| Fricative | - |  | *s* | *x* [ɕ] | *h* [x\~χ] | < |
| Resonant | - | *w* | *l* | *y* [j] | *g* [ɣ\~ʁ] | < |
### Palatal consonants
The consonants *c c' x* are pronounced [tɕ tɕʼ ɕ] respectively, contrasting their post-alveolar realisations [tʃ tʃʼ ʃ] in [[Low Alöbi]].
### Dorsal consonants
High Alöbi retains a contrast between velar [kʼ k] and uvular [qʼ q] plosives which was lost in [[Low Alöbi]], in which the uvulars appear only as allophones of velar plosives next to the vowel *a* [ɑ]. The consonants *h r* lack the contrast, having the same kind of allophonic uvularisation triggered by *a*, changing their basic sounds from [x ɣ] to [χ ʁ] respectively.
## Vowels
|  | - | Front unrounded | Front rounded | Back |
| ---- | ---- | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Close long | - | *i* [iː\~eː] | *ü* [yː\~øː] | *u* [uː\~oː] |
| Close short | - | *e* [ɪ\~e] | *ö* [ʏ\~ø] | *o* [ʊ\~o] |
| Open | - |  |  | a [ɑ] |
All close vowels *i ü u e ö o* are realised as mid vowels [eː øː oː e ø o] respectively when next to a uvular plosive *q* or *q'*.
# Vocabulary
## Sound correspondence with Low Alöbi
Many common vocabulary words are essentially equivalent between [[Low Alöbi]] and High Alöbi, with the differences in sound following predictable rules. The vowels in particular are fairly regularly related, shown in the table below.

|  | - | a | e | ö | o | i | ü | u |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Low Alöbi | - | [ɑ] | [e\~ë̞\~ə] | [ø\~ø̞̈] | [o\~ö̞] | [i\~ɪ] | [y\~ʏ] | [u\~ʊ] |
| High Alöbi | - | [ɑ] | [ɪ\~e] | [ʏ\~ø] | [ʊ\~o] | [iː\~eː] | [yː\~øː] | [uː\~oː] |

Some words have dialect variants in which certain instances of [[Low Alöbi]] *i* [i\~ɪ] correspond to High Alöbi *e* [ɪ]. Such alternation originates from each language undergoing different vowel mergers in their evolution from [[Proto-Öbic language|Proto-Öbic]]: \*i \*ī > *i* [i\~ɪ] in [[Low Alöbi]] and \*i \*e > *e* [ɪ] in High Alöbi. Some examples are shown below:
- [[Proto-Öbic language|PÖb]] \*binem "bitter fish sauce" → [[Low Alöbi|LA]] *binem* [ˈbiˑnəm] ~ HA *penem* [ˈpɪnɪm]
- [[Proto-Öbic language|PÖb]] \*inki "younger sibling" → [[Low Alöbi|LA]] *igki* [ˈiˑŋkɪ] ~ HA *enke* [ˈɪŋkɪ]
- [[Proto-Öbic language|PÖb]] \*cic'ī "red clay" → [[Low Alöbi|LA]] *cic'i* [ˈtʃiˑtʃʼɪ] ~ HA *cec'i* [ˈtʃɪtʃʼiː]
## Loans between High and Low Alöbi
There are many Low Alöbi loanwords in High Alöbi, since the Low dialects are the more culturally influential and socially dominant, though they can be hard to identify since they so closely resemble the expected native forms of the same words. Such loan words often co-exist with their native cognate term, though usually have narrower meanings, and typically follow all the expected sound correspondences. One common alteration is that of unstressed *i ü u* in Low Alöbi to *e ö o* in High Alöbi, some examples of which are shown below:
- [[Low Alöbi|LA]] *wilig* [wil̪ɪ̃(ŋ)] "rod, pole" → HA *wilen* [wiːlɪn] "quant pole" (c.f. native HA *weleg* [wɪlɪɣ] "rod, pole")
- [[Low Alöbi|LA]] *laüm* "corner" [l̪ɑʏ̃(m)] → HA *laöm* [lɑʏm] "fork in a road" (c.f. native HA *gaüm* [ʁɑyːm] "knee, elbow")
- [[Low Alöbi|LA]] *gosum* "sieve" [ŋosʊ̃(m)] → HA *gosom* [ɣʊsʊm] "sieve" (displaced native HA *gosum* [ɣʊsuːm])

Loans from High Alöbi into [[Low Alöbi]] are less common, though there are some notable cases of cultural vocabulary being transferred. One well-known example is *k'ak'ohümi*, the name given to wagon-houses used by [[Öb#Seasonal migration|seasonally-migratory Öb]]. This is a relatively early loan from High Alöbi *q'aq'ogümi* [qʼɑqʼoɣyːmi], a compound of *q'aq'og* "giant snail" and *üm* "wood", yielding "wooden giant snail" (c.f. native [[Low Alöbi]] *t'ak'og* [tʼɑkʼɔ̃(ŋ)] "giant snail"). Note that the change from HA *g* [ɣ] to LA *h* [x] is typical of loans.
