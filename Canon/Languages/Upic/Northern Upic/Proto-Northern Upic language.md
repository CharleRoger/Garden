The **Proto-Northern Upic language** (**PNUp**) is the reconstructed ancestor of the [[Northern Upic languages]] It is thought to have been spoken c. 2,500 - 2,000 BGS in [[Qnōp']].
# Phonology
Below are the reconstructed phonemes of Proto-Northern Upic.
## Consonants
|                  | -   | Labial | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Uvular | Glottal |
| ---------------- | --- |:------:|:--------:|:-------:|:-----:|:------:|:-------:|
| Nasal            | -   |  \*m   |   \*n    |         |       |        |         |
| Ejective plosive | -   |  \*p'  |   \*t'   |  \*c'   | \*k'  |  \*q'  |         |
| Plain plosive    | -   |  \*p   |   \*t    |   \*c   |  \*k  |  \*q   |   \*ʔ   |
| Fricative        | -   |        |   \*s    |   \*x   |  \*h  |   <    |         |
| Resonant         | -   |  \*w   |   \*l    |   \*y   |  \*r  |   <    |         |
| Continuant       | -   |        |          |         |  \*g  |   <    |         |
### Palatal obstruents
In contrast to other [[Upic languages|Upic]] branches which lost the distinctive palatal articulation of the consonants \*c' \*c \*x, Proto-Northern Upic is reconstructed to have retained these as either [cçʼ cç ç] or the sibilant qualities [tɕʼ tɕ ɕ].
### \*g
The reflex of [[Proto-Upic language|Proto-Upic]] \*ħ is transcribed \*g in Proto-Northern Upic, though its phonetic nature is not known as precisely as the other consonants. It is reflected by a dorsal nasal [ŋ~ɴ] in [[Low Alöbi]], while in other Northern Upic languages it is reflected by various non-nasal qualities, including but not limited to [g ʒ ɣ x ʁ χ h j w], and is often lost completely. From this evidence, it can be assumed that \*g was a voiced dorsal continuant, considered likely to be a velar fricative [ɣ].
## Vowels
|       | -   |  Front  |  Back   |
| ----- | --- |:-------:|:-------:|
| Close | -   | \*i \*í | \*u \*ú |
| Open  | -   | \*a \*á | \*o \*ó |

The four cardinal vowels \*i \*u \*a \*o each have a less marked "weak" form and a more marked "strong" form, which may correspond to a greater length or tenseness. The weak vowel \*a may have had a schwa quality [ə] and served as an epenthetic vowel at certain morpheme boundaries, for example the objective noun suffix *\*-(a)n*, which only had *\*-a-* present on consonant-final roots.
# Grammar
The grammatical system of the best attested Northern Upic languages, the [[Öbic languages]], diverged significantly from their less well attested relatives, making it difficult to determine details of the common ancestral grammar. Despite this, certain aspects of Proto-Northern Upic grammar have been reconstructed with some certainty.
## Nouns
### Case
Nouns have four case forms:
- \*-∅ — Adjunct noun or indirect object. This the only nominal form which can take adpositions.
- \*-i — Genitive case, the possessor or relative of another noun.
- \*-(a)n — Absolutive case, the subject of a stative verb or direct object of proper verb.
- \*-in — Ergative case, the agent of a transitive verb.

The particular uses of each nominal form changed as Proto-Northern Upic evolved into its descendent languages. In [[Proto-Öbic language|Proto-Öbic]] for example, the suffix *\*-(a)n* was only used in the absolutive role when possessed by other noun.
