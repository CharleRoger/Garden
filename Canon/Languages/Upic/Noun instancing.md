**Noun instancing** is a grammatical phenomena found in several languages of [[Fountainhead]], in particular [[Low Alöbi]] and its derived mixed language [[Möxali]].

Languages which exhibit noun instancing distinguish two types of reference:
- **Instanced** — countable reference to a particular instance of a thing regardless of definiteness, e.g. "a person", "the person", "two people"
- **Uninstanced** — uncountable reference to a kind or category of thing, e.g. "people" or "humans" in general

When instanced nouns are first introduced to the discourse, an instancing prefix is attached to the noun stem which typically specifies the grammatical number and animacy of the referent. The prefix may be left off subsequent references to the same instanced nouns, which still carry grammatical number as an underlying property. An instancing prefix may also be used to emphasise the number or animacy of a referent, or to clarify which referent is being referred to if it is not clear from context. In most instancing languages, [[proper nouns]] are naturally always instanced.

A newly introduced referent which lacks an instancing prefix is understood to mean reference to the kind or category of a thing in general, rather than to a particular instance of it, i.e. "people (in general)" rather than "a person" or "the person". These uninstanced nouns do not carry grammatical number, but act like plurals in agreement with verb suffixes.
# Möxali
The instancing prefixes of [[Möxali]] are shown in the table below.

| Initial segment | < | - | Vowel | Consonant |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Singular | People | - | *y-* | *e-* |
| ^ | Animate | - | *ti-* | < |
| ^ | Inanimate | - | *v-* | *yo-* |
| Plural | People | - | *ni-* | < |
| ^ | Animate | - | *xi-* | < |
| ^ | Inanimate | - | *xu-* | < |
| Dual | < | - | *k-* | *ke-* |

For example, the inanimate plural prefix (*xu-*) on the noun stem *ikyat* "statement" yields *xíkyat*, according to a sandhi rule which merges |u-i| into *í*, while the singular person prefix on the noun stem *idu* "human" yields *yidu*, using the specific vowel-attaching form *y-*.

These correspond to roughly the same meanings as the equivalent prefixes used in [[Low Alöbi]], from which the [[Möxali]] forms are derived. The dual number is unique in not distinguishing animacy, and has slightly extended its usage from pairs of animate things to small complete sets of two, three and very occasionally four. For example, the [[zívon]] (64 day month) of the [[Öcídñox|Öcídñox calendar]] is sometimes referred to as *kovíne* in reference to its four *ovíne* "great segments" which are each incomplete and exist only as parts of the whole, hence the use of the dual number. Such situations would use the paucal number in [[Low Alöbi]], which is no longer present in [[Möxali]]. The plural number represents any greater number, but unlike in [[Low Alöbi]] can also be used for as little as two referents, so long as those two things aren't considered to form a pair or complete set.
