**Noun instancing** is a grammatical phenomena found in several languages of [[Fountainhead]], in particular [[Low Alöbi]], its derived mixed language [[Möxali]], and its descendent [[Eubli]].

Languages which exhibit noun instancing distinguish two types of reference:

- **Instanced** — countable reference to a particular instance of a thing regardless of definiteness, e.g. "a person", "the person", "two people"
- **Uninstanced** — uncountable reference to a kind or category of thing, e.g. "people" or "humans" in general

When certain nouns are first introduced to the discourse, an instancing prefix is attached to the noun stem which typically specifies the grammatical number and animacy of the referent. A newly introduced referent which lacks an instancing prefix is understood to mean reference to the kind or category of a thing in general, rather than to a particular instance of it, i.e. "people (in general)" rather than "a person" or "the person".

The prefix may be left off subsequent references to the same instanced nouns, which still carry grammatical number as an underlying property. Where applicable, instanced nouns continue to agree with other grammatical elements such as adjectives and verbs with this implicit grammatical number, while a noun which was brought into the discourse without instancing is treated as plural.

An instancing prefix may also be used to emphasise the number or animacy of a referent, to pick out a subset of previously established referents (e.g. *one of the people...*), or to clarify which referent is being referred to if it is not clear from context. In most instancing languages, proper nouns are naturally always instanced.
