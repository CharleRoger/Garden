#language/upic 

The **Upic** /̍ˈuːpɪk/ languages are a family of languages primarily comprised of the [[Cisi]] language spoken in [[Kóty]] and the [[Öbic languages]] originating in [[T'ugü]], though a number of minor Upic languages can be found scattered around western [[Fountainhead]].

# Classification

Upic languages are broadly divided into two groups, [[Northern Upic languages|Northern]] and [[Southern Upic languages|Southern]], characterised by a number of unique sound changes.

## Syllabic nuclei

The most significant difference between the two groups is in the system of syllabic nuclei. In the [[Southern Upic languages|Southern]] languages, monophthongisation yielded two new mid vowels \*e \*o and syllabic liquids \*r̩ \*l̩, while the [[Northern Upic languages|Northern]] languages were initially more conservative. The table below shows the smoothing of vowel + resonant segments in the reconstructed proto-languages of the [[Northern Upic languages|Northern]] and [[Southern Upic languages|Southern]] branches.
