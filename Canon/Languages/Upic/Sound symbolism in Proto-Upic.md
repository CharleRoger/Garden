# Phonetic implications
Investigation into sound symbolism in [[Proto-Upic language|Proto-Upic]] has provided some insight into the phonetic nature of the consonant \*r, specifically whether it was an alveolar or uvular trill. It is evident that \*r appears in similar phonesthemes to the voiced coronal consonants \*n, \*l and \*y, rather than consonants which were likely articulated at or near the uvula like \*q', \*q, \*ʔ, \*ħ and \*h.

The clearest evidence for this is in roots which feature a bilabial coda consonant. Four roots with the structure \*r-P are known:
- *\*rap* "bind, restrain"
- *\*raw* "sew, weave"
- *\*rewp* "net"
- *\*riw* "tie, knot"
The narrow semantic space covered by these roots closely aligns with those with initial \*n, \*l and \*y, pertaining to fabrication and manipulation of cords or textiles, as well as physical restraint and enclosure. In contrast, those beginning with \*q', \*q, \*h, \*ʔ and \*ħ tend to have meanings associated with the sky, weather and wind.

This relationship has been presented as proof that \*r had coronal articulation rather than uvular, either at the time of [[Proto-Upic language|Proto-Upic]] or at an even earlier stage. It has also been suggested that both the alveolar and uvular pronunciations coexisted in free variation, with the alveolar quality prevailing in [[Proto-Öbic language|Proto-Öbic]] and the uvular quality remaining elsewhere. In actual fact, the use of \*r as a sound symbol directly gives us information only about the cognitive perception of the sound, and does not necessarily imply anything about its actual phonetic value.

A further counterpoint to the alveolar \*r theory is that even if it were not coronally articulated, it could still be phono-semantically associated with \*l and \*y through the shared [+resonant] feature. Testing this theory by comparing to \*w, the fourth and final consonant to share this feature, turns out to be difficult due to the small sample size. There are only two known roots which begin with \*w and end in a bilabial consonant, *\*wap* "easy, lightweight" and *\*weyp* "two", neither of which exhibit identifiable sound symbolism.
