> *Consonant inventory of Ħautkar*
* The series of consonants with underdot are retroflex.
* \<ħ> is a rather complicated romanizatin for the many allophonies of /ħ/ being sometimes voiced like a [ʕ] near voiced consonants.
* \<kh> is realized as [k͜x].
* \<ʻ> is realized as [ʔ].
* \<c> is realized as [t͜s].

> *Vowel inventory of Ħautkar*
* \<u> is a tricky letter covering much of the allophonies of /u/ and hiding historical clues, /u/ near dentals is realized as [y], between retroflex consonants it is observed as [o] and in between any other consonant it is realized as [ɤᵝ~ɯ̽ᵝ], elsewhere /u/ is [u~ʊ].
* \<e> is [ɨ~ɪ̈] in between consonants, elsewhere [i].
* \<a> is [ɑ] near /r Ṭ ʔ/, elsewhere [a].


## Syntax
In general, Ħautkar is a strongly head-initial language. It also, as mentioned above, favours the ergative alignment.
### Relative clauses

Relative clauses in Hautkar are made with the special relative pronoun *ar* reconstructed in Proto-Hautaric as _*(q)ar_.

## Morphology
### Nouns

#### Cases 

##### Ergative

 Ergative is a tricky case marked with the addition of the preffix *q-*. e.g. *amðar* 'water' > *qamðar* 'ERG-water', in rare cases the case can trigger metathesis shifting vowels around for the sake of a good sounding word *kmari* 'room' > *qamri* 'ERG/room'.

##### Absolutive

Absolutive is not marked, it is the standard case of all noun roots presented in the language.

##### Genitive

Genitive is another tricky case, being the suffix *-k*. e.g. *msu* 'cat' > *msu-k* 'of the cat' the consonant can become voiced due to the nature of the word in other plural forms, e.g. *kmari* 'room' > *kmarikug-ar* 'of all the rooms in general', in this example the collective form is used.

##### Ablative

Ablative is simply marked by the prefix *b-* with unknown origins, it is attached to the root, it also trigger metathesis and consonant mutation of near by consonants, e.g. *ḥin* 'human' > *biḥn* 'from the man', plurals also recieve special attention here and trigger changes *ḥin* 'human' > *biḥunar* 'from all the humans'.

##### Locative 

Locative, Rotak doesn't properly has a single locative case but three in form of particles that do not trigger any change to the root *remt* 'Elative case' e.g. *orjon* 'house' > *orjon remt* 'out of the house'; *lejud* 'Instrumental and Locative' e.g. *orjon lejud* 'at the house'; *puty* 'Allative' e.g. *orjon puty* 'towards the house'.

### Pitch-Accent

Proto-Hautaric is reconstructed with pitch-accent because of the distribution of accent in daughter languages, each word having it's own accent e.g.
- *bā́tr* 'one'
- *áɣahi* 'bee'
- *kitúq* 'brittle'
- *ursū́n* 'house'

In most of the daughter languages this system became insignificant, except in *Wurár-khé*, it evolved into a rather complex tonal system, theorized to be influenced by Kátic languages.
