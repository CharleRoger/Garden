### Phonotactics

## Grammar
### Nouns
#### Case affixes 
The Ħautkar cases are ergative, absolutive, genitive and locative. The absolutive case is the citation form, and usually consists of the root (occasionally with some suffix like _-i_ attached to the end).

|            | -   | Singular | Plural    | Paucal        | Collective |
| ---------- | --- | -------- | --------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| Absolutive | -   | -/-i     | -i-...-an | Reduplication | \<u>...-ar |
| Ergative   | -   | ʼ-       | ^         | ^             | ^          |
| Genitive   | -   | -k       | ^         | ^             | ^          |
| Ablative   | -   | -c       | ^         | ^             | ^          |
- The **ergative** case is somewhat complicated. It is usually formed by the addition of a prefix ʔ-, accompanied on occasion by certain vowel metatheses. The proto-form of this affix was _*qə-_, and the accent shifts that took place as a result are the origin of almost all the irregularities. For instance, forms like _kheni_ > _ʔekhniarise_ from the proto-forms _*kʰə́ni_ > _*qə́kʰən_i, and this correspondence also explains _gula_ > _qagula_ (coming from _*gulá_ > _*qəgulá_, with no accent-shift). If an _-i_ is added to the absolutive, and on occasion other suffixes, these may be absent in the ergative form. However, some forms, such as _mdari_ > _ʔmadar_, can only be explained by analogy in other roots where the loss of an _-e-_ and the appearance of one occurred, the process began to seem like metathesis. This led to a process of analogy by which certain ergative forms gained an unetymological _-a-_ or _i_ where _-e-_ or _∅_ would be expected.
- The **genitive** case is rather simple. It results from the addition of a _-k_ to the absolutive form. In origin, it was _*(ə)k_.
- The **locative** or **ablative** case serve as the basic 'at, in' inflections in Hautkar.
##### Paucal number
The paucal is formed by partial reduplication of the etymological first syllable.

|        | -   | Sg ABS    | Pauc ABS    | Pauc GEN     | Sg ERG   | Pauc ERG  |
| ------ | --- | --------- | ----------- | ------------ | -------- | --------- |
| woman  | -   | _nêri_    | _nenêri_    | _nenêrik_    | _ʻnêr_   | _ʻnenêr_  |
| bronze | -   | _hirkâda_ | _hihirkâda_ | _hihirkâdak_ | _ʻirkâd_ | _hirkâda_ |
| staff  | -   | _fṭaṣi_   | _fafṭaṣ_    | _fafṭaṣak_   | _ʻafṭaṣ_ | _ʻfafṭaṣ_ |
E.g.: _neri_ "woman" > _neneri_ "a few women", or _hirkâda_ "(piece of) bronze" > _hihirkâda_ "a few pieces of bronze". The ergative form has the same reduplicative element as the absolutive, with the ergative marking going first: e.g.: _fṭaṣi_ "staff for walking" > _ʻafṭaṣ_ "staff" (ergative)’ > _ʻfafṭaṣ_ "a few staves (ergative)".
##### Plural number
The plural is formed by the addition of the suffix _-an_ to the end of the root. E.g.: _gula_ ’wild olive’ > _gulân_ (etymologically _gula-an_) ’wild olives’ An _-a-_ in the previous syllable can also appear sometimes, usually lengthening an _-a-_ to an _-â-_ but also on occasion replacing an _-e-_ (but this is rare), or appearing between a consonants and a glide: _mdari_ ’moving body of water’ > _mdaraian_ ’moving bodies of water’ e.g. _iher_ ’(piece of) copper’ > _iharan_ ’pieces of copper’.
##### Collective

The collective is formed by the addition of the suffix _-ar-_ to the end of the root. This almost always causes an _-u-_ to be inserted. This can replace the second element of a long vowel, e.g.: _ħât_ "Ħautar person" > _ħautar_ "the Ħautar delûr in general". Or, it can simply replace a vowel in the previous syllable, e.g.: _mehai_ "pebble" > _mehuiar_ "pebbles in general".
