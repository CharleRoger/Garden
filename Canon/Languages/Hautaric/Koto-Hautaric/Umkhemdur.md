#language/hautaric #umkhemdurzilur #ħautar_delûr 

**Umkhemdur** is a [[Hautaric languages|Hautaric language]] which was spoken by the [[Umkhemdurzilur]] alongside [[Ħautkar]]-speaking communities.

# History

The origins of the Umkhemdur language are attributed to the arrival of the [[Proto-Hautaric language|Proto-Hautaric]]-speaking people in western [[Kóty]] in the [[1st century BGS]]. From then on, influence from the [[Ħautar delûr]] transformed Umkhemdur into essentially a dialect of [[Ħautkar]].

In the [[8th century]], [[Ħautar delûr|Ħautar]] influence decreased due to attention focused on [[Telehe-Ħautar Conflict|anti-Telehe movements]], allowing the [[Umkhemdurzilur]] to become more politically and linguistically independent. Among many changes, Umkhemdur transitioned from ergative-absolutive to nominative-accusative alignment in this time, leaving only a few remnants of the older system.

Around the [[9th century]], Umkhemdur became the first [[Hautaric languages|Hautaric language]] to adopt writing, specifically the [[Telehe script]], changing its orientation to top-to-bottom and adapting it to the Umkhemdur language. Efforts to record histories of neighbouring [[Ħautar delûr|Ħautaric]] states largely failed due to the extremely conservative approach of the [[Ħautar delûr|Ħautar]] society.
