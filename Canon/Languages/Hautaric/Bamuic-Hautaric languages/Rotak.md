# Grammar

## Morphology

### Nouns

#### Case

##### Absolutive

The absolutive case is not marked, it is the standard case of all noun roots presented in the language.

##### Ergative

 The ergative is a tricky case marked with the addition of the prefix *q-*. e.g. *amðar* 'water' > *qamðar* 'ERG-water', in rare cases the case can trigger metathesis shifting vowels around for the sake of a good sounding word *kmari* 'room' > *qamri* 'ERG/room'.

##### Genitive

The genitive is another tricky case, being the suffix *-k*. e.g. *msu* 'cat' > *msu-k* 'of the cat' the consonant can become voiced due to the nature of the word in other plural forms, e.g. *kmari* 'room' > *kmarikug-ar* 'of all the rooms in general', in this example the collective form is used.

##### Ablative

The ablative is simply marked by the prefix *b-* with unknown origins, it is attached to the root, it also trigger metathesis and consonant mutation of near by consonants, e.g. *ḥin* 'human' > *biḥn* 'from the man', plurals also receive special attention here and trigger changes *ḥin* 'human' > *biḥunar* 'from all the humans'.

##### Locative 

Rotak doesn't have a single locative case but three in form of particles that do not trigger any change to the root *remt* 'Elative case' e.g. *orjon* 'house' > *orjon remt* 'out of the house'; *lejud* 'Instrumental and Locative' e.g. *orjon lejud* 'at the house'; *puty* 'Allative' e.g. *orjon puty* 'towards the house'.
