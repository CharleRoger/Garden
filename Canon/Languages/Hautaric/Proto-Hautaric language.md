### Diphthongs

There are only two diphthongs in Proto-Hautaric, \*ew and \*ey. In most [[Hautaric languages]] like [[Rotak]] and [[Rabak]], they became model vowels /e/ and /o/. Conversely, [[Ħautar delûr|Ħautar]] shifted them to close-mid vowels /ɨ/ and /ʉ/.

## Phonotactics

The syllable structure of Proto-Ħautaric is (S)(C)(C)(S)V(V)(S)(C), where S is a sonorant /r l m n y w/, C is any consonant and V is any vowel.

## Stress

Proto-Hautaric is thought to have had marked pitch accent on some words and otherwise regular penultimate stress [σ.ˈσ.σ].
