#language/hautaric #language_family 

The **Hautaric languages** are a language family of about 4 major languages and minor dialects spoken predominantly in [[Kóty]] and parts of the [[Khey desert]].

[[Ħautkar|Ħautkar]], counted as a single language, was by far the most spoken within the family, with around 200 million native speakers during the [[6th century]] concentrated primarily in the [[Ħautar delûr]], followed only by languages of the [[Bamuic-Hautaric languages]] such as [[Rabak|Rabak]], [[Rotak|Rotak]] and [[Lovok|Lovok]].

The reconstructed hypothetical ancestor of the Hautaric languages is [[Proto-Hautaric language|Proto-Hautaric]].

# Internal classification

Hautaric languages are generally grouped into [[Koto-Hautaric languages]] ([[Ħautkar]], [[Umkhemdur]]), [[Bamuic-Hautaric languages]] ([[Lovok]], [[Rabak]] and [[Rotak]]) and other unclassified languages such as [[Wurár-K'í]].
