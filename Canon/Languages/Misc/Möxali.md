**Möxali** is a [[Xiri]]-[[Low Alöbi]] mixed language which emerged in bilingual communities of [[Xiyeru]] in [[T'ugü]] following the [[Exodus period#The Great Departure (c. 660 - 700/701 AGS)|Xiyeru exodus]]. It was the primary language of the [[Lavondu]] people of [[T'ugü]], and a lingua franca throughout surrounding coastal regions of [[Fountainhead]], particularly those connected to [[T'ugü]] by maritime trade. 
# Phonology
Möxali was most commonly spoken as a second language by many peoples over a wide area throughout its long history, so there is much variation in the phonology. There are, however, some patterns and general tendencies common to all speakers or particular subgroups. In order to view Möxali as a whole, its phonology is discussed here using the romanisation of its core phonemic inventory, which is common to almost all varieties of the language. Each phoneme can be understood as representing a diaphoneme, an abstracted phonological unit with an analogous phoneme in each variety of Möxali, which may have different phonetic realisations depending on the dialect or historical stage. Particular phonetic varieties are also given in square brackets where relevant.
## Consonants
|  | - | Labial | Alveolar | Postalveolar / Palatal | Dorsal | Glottal |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Nasal | - | *m* [m] | *n* [n\~n̪] | *ñ* [ɲ] | *g* [ŋ\~ɴ] | (*q* [ʔ]) |
| Voiceless plosive | - | *p* [p] | *t* [t\~t̪\~t̪ˢ] | *c* [tʃ\~tɕ] | *k* [k\~q] |  |
| Voiceless fricative | - | *f* [f\~ɸ] | *s* [s\~s̪\~θ] | *x* [ʃ\~ɕ] | *h* [x\~χ\~h] |  |
| Voiced plosive | - | *b* [b] | *d* [d\~d̪\~dᶻ] | *j* [(d)ʒ\~(d)ʑ] |  |  |
| Voiced fricative | - | *v* [v\~β\~w] | *z* [z\~z̪\~ð] | ^ |  |  |
| Approximant | - | ^ | *l* [l\~l̪] | *y* [j] |  |  |
| Tap or trill | - |  | *r* [ɾ\~r] |  |  |  |
### Alveolar tap
The consonant *r* is an alveolar tap [ɾ] or occasionally a trill [r] which only occurs intervocalically, most commonly as an allophone of *d*. The origin of *r* lies in the intervocalic allophone of the [[Xiri]] rhotic [ɾ], while in initial position this consonant was pronounced [ɹ] which became Möxali *l*. Because of this, the vast majority of occurrences of *r* stem directly from [[Xiri]], though some words replaced intervocalic *r* with *l* (e.g. *valon* "yam wine", from [[Xiri]] *warań*) via early dialectal intermixing during the formation of Möxali.

In the native writing of Möxali, the [[Opsíbdañox]], *r* is written with the same letters as *l*, and in formal texts *l* can be distinguished by adding the [[Opsíbdañox#Vikvínon|vikvínon]], which more typically functions as a devoicing diacritic. Despite it being taught as a separate consonant by the scribal schools in [[T'ugü]], its phonemic status is marginal at best in even the most conservative Möxali, while in all Outer Möxali dialects *r* and intervocalic *d* are merged into [ɾ~r] as a rule. Educated speakers of Inner Möxali, particularly in its early literary history in the [[9th century|9th]] and [[10th century|10th]] centuries AGS, often prescribed the pronunciation of intervocalic *d* as [d̪], maintaining a distinction with *r* [ɾ] in slow, careful speech. By around the [[14th century]], all speakers of Möxali had merged *r* with intervocalic *d*, though the orthographic standards retain the spelling of *r* as separate to *d*.
### Glottal stop
The glottal stop *q* is phonemic only in Inner Möxali, the dialect which remained spoken in [[T'ugü]] after the Möxali language was carried elsewhere by population migration. The group of emigrant dialects, Outer Möxali, do not have the phoneme *q*, but still have a phonetic glottal stop with predictable epenthetic placement between vowels. The phonetic glottal stop is romanised as ⟨'⟩ for clarity, but is not represented in the native script. Compare the following examples:

|              | -   | Meaning        | Native spelling | Romanisation | Phonetic    |
| ------------ | --- | -------------- | --------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Inner Möxali | -   | daytime        | QE-LO-SA        | *qelos*      | [ʔe̞.l̪o̞θ] |
| Outer Möxali | -   | ^              | E-RO-ZA         | *elos*       | [ɛ.l̪ɔs̪]   |
| Inner Möxali | -   | [[Rubroplano]] | DA-QÍ-BE        | *daqíb*      | [d̪ɑ.ʔib]   |
| Outer Möxali | -   | ^              | DA-Í-VE         | *da'ív*      | [d̪ɑ.ʔiv]   |

Note that common Outer Möxali spelling additionally does not use certain diacritics, thus *l* and *s* are not distinguished from *r* and *z* respectively.
### Front-back allophones
Some consonants have a pair of allophones determined by the presence of a front (*e ö i í*) or back (*a o u ú*) vowel in the host syllable. These allophonic pairs or some variants of them are present in the vast majority of speakers, particularly those who speak Möxali as a first language or are in regular contact with those who do. The typical phonetic values of these allophonic pairs are shown below:

|       | -   | *t*   | *d*   | *s*  | *z*  | *c*  | *x* | *j* | *g*   | *k*   | *h*   |
| ----- | --- | ----- | ----- | ---- | ---- | ---- | --- | --- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Front | -   | [t̪ˢ] | [d̪ᶻ] | [s̪] | [z̪] | [tɕ] | [ɕ] | [ʑ] | [ŋʲ]  | [kʲ]  | [xʲ]  |
| Back  | -   | [t̪]  | [d̪]  | [θ]  | [ð]  | [tʃ] | [ʃ] | [ʒ] | [ŋ~ɴ] | [k~q] | [x~χ] |

The uvular qualities of the velar consonants are generally only used by bilingual speakers of [[Low Alöbi]] and later [[Eubli]], which both feature these phones extensively, especially next to the vowel *a*.
## Vowels
|           | -   | Front unrounded | Front rounded  | Back         |
| --------- | --- | --------------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| Close     | -   | *í* [i]         |                | *ú* [u]      |
| Close-mid | -   | *i* [e\~ɪ]      | *ö* [œ\~ø̞\~ʏ] | *u* [o\~ʊ]   |
| Open-mid  | -   | *e* [ɛ\~e̞]     | ^              | *o* [ɔ\~o̞]] |
| Open      | -   |                 |                | *a* [ä\~ɑ]   |

The mid vowels (*i u e ö o*) are realised as [ɪ ʊ e̞ ø̞ o̞] in the [[Möxali#Inner Möxali|inner dialects]] of [[T'ugü]] and most typically [e o ɛ œ ɔ] elsewhere. *ö* in particular can vary in height quite freely between [œ] and [ʏ] depending on speaker and phonological environment, but the height hierarchy *e* < *ö* < *i* is usually maintained.

The open vowel *a* varies between central and back qualities, with the furthest back [ɑ] typically used by bilingual speakers of [[Low Alöbi]] and triggering the uvular consonant allophones described above.

In addition to the eight typically contrastive vowels, there are four nasalised vowels *in un en on*, which are often considered to be sequences of a vowel and an underlying nasal consonant. When occurring before a stop (plosive or nasal), the nasalised vowels are realised with a nasal stop assimilated to the place of articulation of the following consonant, otherwise they are lengthened.
> *binbin* "fly (insect)" — Inner [bɪ̃mbɪ̃ː]; Outer [bẽmbẽː]
> *tinno* "salt" — Inner [t̪ɪ̃n̪n̪o̞]; Outer [t̪ˢẽn̪n̪ɔ]
> *vonjal* "horizon" — Inner [βõ̞ndʒɑl̪]; Outer [vɔ̃ːʒɑl̪]
## Phonotactics
Möxali's syllable structure is (OR/C)V(D), where O is an obstruent (*p t c k b d f s x v z j*), R is an approximant (*v l y*) with a different place of articulation to O, C is any consonant, V is any vowel (*e ö i í a o u ú*), and D may be any consonant except *y* (*p t c k b d f s x h v z j l*).

The Outer Möxali dialects developed a further restriction on coda consonants which meant plosives were no longer allowed, described in detail [[Möxali#Coda neutralisation|below]].

Coda *n* nasalises the preceding vowel and, if there is a following consonant, manifests as a nasal stop which phonetically assimilates to the place of articulation of that consonant.

Since *v* patterns both as a fricative and an approximant in the context of syllable structure, it is the only consonant that can occur as a single onset, be either consonant in an onset cluster or be a syllable coda. The allowed syllable onsets are shown in the table below.

|  | < | < | - | Medial approximant | < | < | < |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
|  | < | < | - | ∅ | *v* | *l* | *y* |
| Initial consonant | Labial | *m* | - | *m-* |  |  |  |

# Morphophonology
It is useful to analyse the structure of Möxali as having an underspecified morphophonemic level, with phonotactics and other regular processes yielding the phonemic level. Morphophonemic forms are shown in |vertical bars|. In addition to the phonotactic constraints on onset clusters described above, there are five main phenomena; coda neutralisation, obstruent devoicing, inversion, vowel sandhi and vowel elision.
## Coda neutralisation
While coda plosives were initially allowed in Möxali and are retained in the Inner dialect, they were lost in the later and more widespread Outer dialects. In these dialects, underlying plosives undergo spirantisation when they fall in coda position, in which they mutate to the corresponding fricative with the same voicedness and place of articulation: *p t c k b d* → *f s x h v z*. This results in inflectional alternation like the following:
- |límok-∅| → *límoh* (bee-ᴀʙꜱ)
- |límok-en| → *límokin* (bee-ᴇʀɢ)

The donation of a plosive to a following syllable can occur across morpheme or word boundaries, meaning the phonological form of a word can depend on the following word:
> [fɑ.d̪ᶻɛ̃ː ɑ.ʒɔ.q‿u.l̪o fɛ.ʔɑ]
> `faden    ajok -∅    úl  ~u     f[a]-e -q[a]`
> `1SG.NOM  stone-ABS  work~PROG  ACT- do-PFV `
> "I work stone"

Despite this spirantisation rule being present in the most commonly spoken forms of Möxali throughout history, the native orthography tends to favour more conservative spelling in formal contexts, e.g. ⟨LÍ-MO-KA⟩ rather than ⟨LÍ-MO-HA⟩ for *límoh*. For consistency and clarity, romanisation of Möxali generally uses conservative spelling unless otherwise stated, i.e. *límok* not *límoh*.
## Obstruent devoicing
Voiced obstruents (*b d j z v*) devoice to (*p t c s f*) when in a cluster with any voiceless consonant (*p t c k q f s x h*). For example, the [[Low Alöbi]] verb *ubsöb* (write) is reflected in Möxali as *upsöb*, the adjunct form of which *opsíb-d-a* (written) is the source of the name of Möxali's script [[Opsíbdañox]] "sacred written thing". The stativiser suffix *-d* will also similarly devoice when next to a voiceless consonant, for example the verb *mídös* (to smoke, as of meat) yields the adjunct form *midista* (smoked). This voicedness alternation is most commonly seen in the aspect conjugation of verb roots:

|          |              | -   | *yub-* (reign) | *díj-* (touch) | *zav-* (die) |
| -------- | ------------ | --- | -------------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| Voiced   | Progressive  | -   | *yubo*         | *díji*         | *zava*       |
| ^        | Prospective  | -   | *yubje*        | *díje*         | *zavje*      |
| ^        | Continuative | -   | *yubyo*        | *díjo*         | *zavyo*      |
| ^        | Inchoative   | -   | *yubli*        | *díjli*        | *zavli*      |
| ^        | Resumptive   | -   | *yubño*        | *díjño*        | *zavño*      |
| ^        | Defective    |     | *yube*         | *díjbe*        | *zavbe*      |
| Devoiced | Perfective   | -   | *yup(qa)*      | *díc(qa)*      | *zaf(qa)*    |
| ^        | Cessative    | -   | *yupco*        | *díco*         | *zafco*      |
| ^        | Iterative    | -   | *yupto*        | *dícto*        | *zafto*      |

The exception to this rule is the consonant *v* following another consonant, in which position it acts as a medial approximant, thus is not itself subject to obstruent devoicing. For example, the [[Low Alöbi]] adjective *wik'wa* (different) is reflected in Möxali by *víkva* [ˈβi.kβ̞ɑ] rather than *\*víkfa* [ˈβik.ɸɑ].

The same devoicing rule applies across word boundaries, as well as at the boundaries of an utterance, though *b* often remains voiced in the latter case. For example, the phrase *den-díhaj* spoken in isolation would typically be rendered as [t̪ˢɛn̪d̪ᶻiχɑtʃ].
## Inversion
Inversion is an ablaut process which acts on both vowels in a disyllabic stem. It developed out of an archaic stress rule in Xiri which is no longer active in Möxali, and through analogy has become a regular process triggered by certain suffixes. Vowels i í u ú in the first syllable are lowered to e i o u, and vowels e ö i o u in the second syllable are raised to i i í u ú respectively:

|  | - | *ö* | *e* | *i* | *í* | *a* | *o* | *u* | *ú* |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Lowered by inversion | - | *ö* | *e* | < | *i* | *a* | *o* | < | *u* |
| Raised by inversion | - | *i* | < | *í* | < | *a* | *u* | *ú* | < |

In compounds of two stems, the first stem is inverted:
- |cílom-∅| → *cílon* (blood-ᴀʙꜱ)
- |cílom\⇵-yuvek-∅| → *ciluñuvek* (bloodfish-ᴀʙꜱ)

When a polysyllabic word is formed by attaching morphemes to the front of the base stem in this way, the stem itself still undergoes inversion in its inflection:
- |cílom\⇵-yuvek\⇵-eb| → *ciluñovikeb* (bloodfish-ᴀᴄᴄ)

Exactly what constitutes the Möxali stem is difficult to rigidly define, some polymorphemic structures count as stems while others do not, but stems are always disyllabic. For example, the additive numerals, which are special forms of the basic numeral roots which were formed in [[Low Alöbi]] with the addition of a suffix *-ö*. In Möxali, these additive numerals exist only in compounds and are considered disyllabic stems, so are always inverted:
- |uj-| *uj-* (one) → |ujö\⇵-kvöj-| *ojikvöj-* (fifty one)
- |víb-| *víb-* (two) → |víbö\⇵-kvöj-| *vibikvöj-* (fifty two)
- |níf-| *níf-* (three) → |nífö\⇵-kvöj-| *nifikvöj-* (fifty three)
- |bíx-| *bíx-* (four) → |bíxö\⇵-kvöj-| *bixikvöj-* (fifty four)
## Vowel sandhi
Morphemes with an initial vowel avoid placing that vowel adjacent to a previous vowel by a sandhi process determined by the qualities of the two vowels. In the context of sandhi, (*e i í*) and (*o u ú*) form natural groups labelled **E** and **O** respectively.

If the first vowel is higher than the second vowel on the hierarchy *a* < {*e ö o*} < {*i í u ú*}, an epenthetic approximant is inserted between the two vowels, *y* after front vowels and *v* after back rounded vowels:

|  | - | E | *ö* | O |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| *a* | - | (E)*ya* | (ö)*ya* | (O)*va* |
| *e* | - | (E)*ye* | / | (O)*ve* |
| *ö* | - | (E)*yö* | / | (O)*vö* |
| *o* | - | (E)*yo* | / | (O)*vo* |

The vowels in brackets are subject to regular elision as described in the next section.

If the first vowel is the same height or lower than the second, they merge into a single vowel with quality determined by the following table:

|  | - | *a* | E | *ö* | O |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| *a* | - | a | / | / | / |
| E | - | e | i | < | < |
| *ö* | - | ö | < | < | i |
| O | - | o | ö | < | u |

A full table of possible vowel sandhi combinations is shown below:

|  | - | *a* | e | *ö* | o | i | u |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| *a* | - | a | (e)ya | (ö)ya | (o)va | (i)ya | (u)va |
| e | - | e | i | < | < | (i)ye | (u)ve |
| *ö* | - | ö | < | < | i | (i)yö | (u)vö |
| o | - | o | ö | < | u | (i)yo | (u)vo |
| i | - | e | i | < | < | < | < |
| u | - | u | ö | < | u | ö | u |

The close vowels (*í ú*) are considered equivalent to the mid-close vowels (*i u*) in sandhi processes. This equivalence has two consequences:
- If a merged vowel *i* or *u* lands in a stressed syllable, which it most often does, the resulting quality will be *í* or *ú* respectively.
- *í* and *ú* are not considered higher than *i* and *u*, thus |í-i| does not yield *íye*, but *í*. Note that *i*, and by extension *í*, are both considered higher than *e*, so |i-e| yields *iye*.

In Outer Möxali (OM) dialects, the lack of a glottal stop at the phonemic level can obscure the predictable behaviour of the vowel sandhi. Words which historically began with the glottal stop *q*, which is retained in Inner Möxali (IM), do not undergo vowel sandhi despite being apparently vowel-initial. These can be analysed as having an underlying glottal stop, which technically need not exist at the phonemic level despite sometimes manifesting at the phonetic level. Compare the following examples:
- |'añon| *añon* (lid, cf. IM *qañon*) → |xu-'añon| *xu'añon* (ᴘʟ-lid), underlying glottal stop blocks interaction between vowel qualities
- |onxub| *onxub* (adze, cf. IM *onxub*) → |xu-onxub| *xvonxub* (ᴘʟ-adze), sandhi interaction present

Note that sandhi processes apply only at morpheme boundaries, thus the full range of Möxali's phonology can be expressed elsewhere within the morpheme, e.g. Outer Möxali *mú'a* "long (of time)" may be analysed /mua/ with an epenthetic glottal stop.
## Vowel elision
Stressed vowels may never be elided, but there are several circumstances which trigger the regular elision of unstressed vowels. One such circumstance is in the consonant epenthesis of vowel-initial morphemes described above:
- |su-azi| → \*s(o)ˈvazi → *ˈsvazi*

This elision is blocked by an approximant in the syllable onset:
- |kyo-azi| → \*ky(o)ˈvazi → *kyoˈvazi*

If the approximant has the same place of articulation as that preceding onset, it too is elided:
- |ijí-azi| → \*íj(i)ˈyazi → \*iˈj(y)azi → *iˈjazi* (Note also the inversion of the initial stem *íji-* → *ijí-*)

Some morphemes, particularly short inflectional affixes, have two allomorphs, one with the vowel *a* and one with the vowel elided. This is shown in square brackets in the underlying morphophonemic notation. The presence of the vowel depends on its morphophonological environment and functions as epenthesis wherever phonotactically required. For example, consider the active voice prefix |f[a]-| and the perfective suffix |-q[a]|:
- When preceding a vowel or approximant or following a simple vowel-consonant sequence, the [a] is not necessary and so is not present:
	- |f[a]-u-q[a]| → *fuq* (ᴀᴠ-eat-ᴘꜰᴠ)
	- |f[a]-la-q[a]| → *flaq* (ᴀᴠ-cook-ᴘꜰᴠ)
- When preceding any other consonant or following a complex consonant cluster, the [a] is required to avoid a cluster occurring at the start of end of the word:
	- |f[a]-mum-q[a]| → *famunqa* (ᴀᴠ-fill-ᴘꜰᴠ)
	- |f[a]-qar-q[a]| → *faqalqa* (ᴀᴠ-sail-ᴘꜰᴠ)
# Dialects
The history of Möxali features two major dialect groups, Inner and Outer Möxali, which each have unique features and geographic distributions.
## Inner Möxali
Inner Möxali was spoken primarily as the first language of the [[Lavondu]] in [[T'ugü]], thus its evolution was shaped by continued contact with [[Low Alöbi]]. It was generally the most conservative dialect, featuring comparatively little change from the earliest attested Möxali c. [[8th century]]. This conservatism partly stems from the origins of Inner Möxali as a register of the early spoken language, which may have originated from a deliberate effort by the [[Lavondu]] to preserve a more "authentic" manner of speech. The early evolution of the speech patterns and vocabulary of this register were primarily guided by historical texts, resulting in many unique features produced by a what was essentially a feedback loop. Newly written texts aiming to emulate the styles of older texts often introduced new quirks which informed the speech of later speakers.

The orthographic tendencies of all variants of Möxali are continuations of earlier forms of the language, meaning they most closely resemble the conservative dialect. Despite this association, Inner Möxali should not be confused with a literary language, of which there was no clear standard for most of Möxali's history.

The most characteristic feature of Inner Möxali phonology is the retention of coda plosives, which are not present in the outer dialects. The other unique features are mostly superficial differences in the pronunciation of certain phonemes:
- The labial fricatives (*f v*) are bilabial [ɸ β], rather than labiodental [f v]
- *j* is typically pronounced as an affricate [dʒ~dʑ], rather than a fricative [ʒ~ʑ]
- The vowels (*i ö u*) are realised as [ɪ œ ʊ], rather than close-mid [e ø o]

The front/back consonant allophones described [[Möxali#Front-back allophones|above]] were present in first language speakers, but less so in second language speakers, i.e. [[Öb]] who spoke [[Low Alöbi]] as a first language. In [[Öb]]-style Inner Möxali, the velar consonants (*g k h*) were uvular [ɴ q χ] next to the vowel *a* and sometimes next to other back vowels, while the coronal obstruents (*t d s z c x j*) were [t̪ d̪ θ ð tʃ ʃ (d)ʒ] in all environments, never the allophones [t̪ˢ d̪ᶻ s̪ z̪ tɕ ɕ (d)ʑ] which were present next to front vowels for most other speakers.
## Outer Möxali
Outer Möxali was a collection of dialects which were spread throughout the coast of [[Fountainhead]] beginning at the end of the [[9th century]]. There was more variation in the outer dialects than in Inner Möxali, but there still existed many common features which distinguished them as a related group. Outer Möxali was spoken as a first language by some [[Lavondu]] settlements along [[Fountainhead|Fountainhead's]] coast, but most commonly as a second language by many other cultures, including but not limited to: the [[Xiyeru]], [[Ansang people]], and speakers of [[Nambāno]] dialects.

Whereas Inner Möxali adopted many unique monomorphemic verb stems from [[Low Alöbi]], the outer dialects used far fewer, instead tending to innovate new stems more readily using root-aspect constructions.

All outer dialects exhibit the coda spirantisation rule described [[Möxali#Coda neutralisation|above]], leaving no coda plosives at the phonemic level and inflectional alternation between fricatives and plosives in many words. For example, compare the inflectional set *tanih*/*tanikin*/*tanikab* "knife" (with underlying |k| to *ínih*/*ínihin*/*ínihab* "finger" (with underlying |h|). The consonants (*f v*) are almost always labiodental [f v] in the outer dialects, but *v* was always a bilabial approximant [β̞] when acting as the medial approximant in a syllable onset cluster. The dental consonants (*n t d s z l*) are often alveolar [n t d s z l] rather than true dental [n̪ t̪ d̪ s̪~θ z̪~ð l̪], or in some regions these are in free variation.

Another common feature of Outer Möxali is the rhotacism of *d* to [ɾ~r] when following a vowel, i.e. between vowels and in coda position. This rhotacism generally does not represent a phonemic change, though some dialects later developed a distinction between /r/ and /d/, and such cases of /d/ [ɾ~r] are sometimes written as ⟨R⟩ rather than ⟨D⟩ even in those dialects that did not.

Written language used conservative spelling in formal and culturally important texts, perhaps due to the cultural influence of Inner Möxali or just a continuation of older tradition, while more everyday writing frequently featured unique spellings which more accurately represented dialectal forms. The letters ⟨QA QE⟩ were dropped completely in written Outer Möxali, reflecting the loss of the phonemic glottal stop *q*. The glottal stop [ʔ] still occurs at the phonetic level as epenthesis between two adjacent vowels, blocking sandhi in some circumstances. This can be analysed as an underlying glottal stop, but it is not necessary to consider it a separate consonant, which is likely why the Q-letters fell out of use in favour of the null-onset vowels. Despite lack of representation in the native script, the phonetic glottal stop in Outer Möxali is romanised as ⟨'⟩ within words for clarity of reading.
# Grammar
Möxali is an agglutinative language, in which words are formed by attaching several classes of affixes to disyllabic word stems. Transitive verbs, statives and numerals have their stems derived from monosyllabic roots with some classificatory suffix attached, while noun stems are disyllabic morphemes which cannot be broken down.

Transitive verbs take inflectional affixes for mood, voice and aspect but are not inflected for person, number or tense. Tense is generally denoted by temporal adjuncts or understood from context. The person of the subject may optionally be marked with a prefix to refer back to a previously established subject, but this is not strictly part of the verb's inflection.

Möxali's morphosyntactic alignment has characteristics of ergativity and its transitive verbs use a system of symmetrical voice to mark the syntactic role of the subject of the verb. Nouns are marked for absolutive, ergative and accusative case and have additional optional number marking.
## Content words
### Lexical classes
Content words in Möxali are categorised into three lexical classes distinguished by valency, that is the number of arguments they take:
- **Nouns** cannot be predicate (zero arguments)
- **Statives** can be predicate with exactly one argument
- **Transitives** can be predicate with one or more arguments
### Nouns
#### Case
Nouns take an obligatory inflection for case, of which there are three which mark different morphosyntactic roles. The default unmarked case is the absolutive, used for the sole argument of a stative verb or the object of most transitive verbs. Some transitive verbs use a different alignment in which the subject takes the absolutive case and the object takes the dative case. The dative case can also be used to express a recipient or benefactive role with many ordinary ergative verbs. The dative case is also the usual case governed by prepositions, though a small handful of adnominal and locative prepositions govern the absolutive case.

The ergative suffix is subject to [[Möxali#Vowel sandhi|sandhi]] with a preceding vowel:
- |udok-in| → *udokin* (lizard-ᴇʀɢ)
- |ana-in| → *anen* (mouth-ᴇʀɢ)
- |tinno-in| → *tinnín* (salt-ᴇʀɢ)

This sandhi process treats stem-final nasalised vowels like ordinary vowels, though this is not necessarily true in general. All four nasalised vowels, *in un en on*, become *in* due to the ergative suffix.
- |ösen-in| → *ösin* (firewood-ᴇʀɢ)
- |yojon-in| → *yojin* (rib-ᴇʀɢ)
- |adun-in| → *adin* (pouch-ᴇʀɢ)

The dative case has two allomorphs, *-b* and *-ab,* depending on whether the stem ends in a vowel or a consonant respectively.
- |udok-[a]b| → *udokab* (lizard-ᴅᴀᴛ)
- |ana-[a]b| → *anab* (mouth-ᴅᴀᴛ)
- |tino-[a]b| → *tinob* (salt-ᴅᴀᴛ)

The underlying form of the stem is important to consider for case inflection, particularly in the peripheral dialects which exhibit coda plosive spirantisation. Compare the inflectional set *tanih*/*tanikin*/*tanikab* (knife) to *ínih*/*ínihin*/*ínihab* (finger), with the underlying forms |tanik| and |ínih| respectively.
#### Instancing and number
Nouns in Möxali exhibit the phenomenon of [[Noun instancing|instancing]], a trait inherited from [[Low Alöbi]], where nouns distinguish two types of reference:
- **Instanced** — countable reference to a particular instance of a thing regardless of definiteness, e.g. "a person", "the person", "two people"
- **Uninstanced** — uncountable reference to a kind or category of thing, e.g. "people" or "humans" in general

Each instancing prefix ends in a vowel which is subject to sandhi with an initial vowel on the stem. Each prefix has a specific allomorph for vowel-initial and consonant-initial stems, shown in the table below.

| Initial segment | < | - | Vowel | Consonant |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Singular | Human | - | *y-* | *e-* |
| ^ | Animate | - | *c-* | *ti-* |
| ^ | Inanimate | - | *v-* | *yo-* |
| Plural | Human | - | *ñ-* | *ni-* |
| ^ | Animate | - | *x-* | *xi-* |
| ^ | Inanimate | - | *xun-* | *xu-* |
| Dual | < | - | *k-* | *ke-* |
### Transitive verbs
The origin of Möxali's transitive verb morphology is an unusual mixture of [[Low Alöbi|Alöbi]]-style agglutination and [[Xiri]] morphemes and syntax. A verb stem consists of a root with a suffix marking aspect. A verb stem then additionally takes obligatory prefixes for mood and voice optional other prefixes. The verb template is shown below, with the optional slots in brackets.

| Optional prefixes | <                    | Obligatory prefixes | Stem | <      | Optional suffixes |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- | ---- | ------ | ----------------- |
| Subject           | Incorporated adjunct | Voice               | Root | Aspect | Polarity          |
#### Subject
The subject prefix is present only when an explicit subject noun is not. These come directly from [[Xiri]] and are the only remnant of its pronominal system, which was completely supplanted by the [[Low Alöbi]] system. Unlike freestanding pronouns, these prefixes do not mark grammatical number, only first, second and third person as follows:
- First person |ñ[a]-|
- Second person |su-|
- Third person |mi-|

The first person prefix appears as *ñ-* on vowel-initial stems and *ña-* on consonant-initial stems, while the second and third person prefixes may also appear as *sv-* and *ñ-* (← \*my-) respectively, according to regular morphophonological processes.

The syncretism of the first and third person on vowel-initial stems rarely leads to ambiguity, as the subject prefix is used only to refer back to a recently established subject of another verb. Consider the following example:
> Mu-faden den-ínen nötíquq i ax-ñuri
> `mu- faden    den-     ína   -in   nötö-∅-qu   -q[a]  i     ax-  ñ[a]-u  -ri`
> `VIS-1PL.ABS  1SG.POSS-parent-ERG  meat-PV-bring-PFV  CONJ  PERM-1-   eat-INCH`
> "We were brought meat by my parent, and so we could start eating (like animals)"

The subject prefix *ñ-* on *ñuri* is understood by context to refer to the first person *faden* established as the core argument in the previous phrase rather than a third person reference to the ergative noun *den-ínen*.

The subject prefix slot is also used to form the imperative with the prefix *i-*, which takes the form *y-* before vowels.
> [ˈœ.s̪ɛ̃ː iˈbœbœ]
> `ösen    -∅    í-    -böb      ~ö   `
> `firewood-ABS  IMP-PV-gather_up~PROG`
> "Get to gathering up some firewood!"
#### Stem and aspect
The transitive verb stem is usually disyllabic, either a single morpheme with a fixed lexical aspect or derived from a monosyllabic root by addition of a monosyllabic suffix marking the aspect. The formation of a verb stem is closer to derivation than regular inflection, with particular verb stem formations often carrying nuanced meanings, and the polymorphemic verb stems, never roots, appearing in compounds.

There are nine verb aspects, each with a suffix for deriving new verb stems from roots, show in the table below.

| Aspect       | -   | Suffix    | Description                                                                  |
| ------------ | --- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Progressive  | -   | \|\~V\|   | Ongoing action or state                                                      |
| Perfective   | -   | \|-q[a]\| | Simple action, often semelfactive in nature                                  |
| Prospective  | -   | \|-je\|   | Action occuring later than a time under consideration                        |
| Continuative | -   | \|-yo\|   | Action still ongoing at a time under consideration                           |
| Inchoative   | -   | \|-ri\|   | Commencing action, beginning of a state                                      |
| Cessative    | -   | \|-co\|   | Completed action, end of a state                                             |
| Resumptive   | -   | \|-ño\|   | Resumed action or success after failed attempts                              |
| Defective    | -   | \|-be\|   | Temporarily paused action, action prevented from continuing or failed action |
| Iterative    | -   | \|-to\|   | Single instance of a repetitious action                                      |
The progressive is formed by a reduplication of the root vowel, which is modified according to the same phonological lowering process seen in [[Möxali#Inversion|inversion]], in which close vowels are changed to their more open counterpart (u ú i í → o u e i).
- |yad~V| → *yada* (show-ᴘʀᴏɢ)
- |min~V| → *mine* (cultivate-ᴘʀᴏɢ)
- |qúr~V| → *qúru* (sharpen-ᴘʀᴏɢ)

If the verb root ends in a vowel, a glottal stop is inserted before the reduplicated vowel
- |qo~V| → *qoqo* (carry-ᴘʀᴏɢ)
- |vi~V| → *viqe* (break-ᴘʀᴏɢ)
- |ví~V| → *víqi* (see-ᴘʀᴏɢ)

The perfective suffix *-qa* has an allomorph *-q* following a vowel as described [[Möxali#Inversion|above]], but can also be dropped completely when following an obstruent, leaving the effect of devoicing:
- |dus~q[a]| → *dusqa* or *dus* (hunt-ᴘꜰᴠ)
- |dúz~q[a]| → *dúsqa* or *dús* (carve-ᴘꜰᴠ)
- |míb~q[a]| → *mípqa* or *míp* (wrap-ᴘꜰᴠ)

#### Polarity
A final polarity suffix may be used to mark a verb as negative or emphatic.
- |-s[a]| — Negative
- |-x[a]| — Emphatic
### Valency-decreasing suffixes
A ubiquitous pillar of Möxali's grammar is a closed set of valency-decreasing suffixes which convert a word from one class to another:
- ***-j*** / ***-c*** — Converts a noun stem into a stative stem, the state of being associated with the noun
- ***-d*** / ***-t*** — Converts a transitive stem into a stative stem, the state of participating in the verb
- ***-n*** — Converts a transitive stem into a noun stem, the act of the verb itself

These processes are derivational in nature, involving a change in class and the production of a different part of speech, but are practically as regular as inflection. A newly derived word using one of these suffixes tends to retain a strong semantic relationship to the basic stem from which they are derived, unlike other more typical derivational patterns in Möxali. For example, consider the following derivations from the transitive root *líj-* "divide":
- *lícto-d-* — stative stem: the state of undergoing iterated division (transitive → stative)
- *líji-n* — noun stem: the act of ongoing division (transitive → noun)
- *líji-n-c-* — stative stem: the state of being associated with the act ongoing division (transitive → noun → stative)

Compare the following other derivations, showing semantic abstraction from the original stem:
- *xiya-líji* — transitive stem: to fairly share between people (lit. "fair-divide", a stative-transitive compound)
- *lictu-d-n-e* — noun stem: a particular short unit of time (lit. "divide.ɪᴛᴇʀ-ꜱᴛᴀᴛ-n-ᴄʟꜰ", a numeral classifier construction using the dummy root *-n-* and the classifier *-e* for segmented things, i.e. "segment which has been iteratively divided")

There are various extensions and variations of these suffixes. One common derivation is *-jaqe* which forms a phrasal adverb from a noun describing the circumstances or context, usually appearing at the beginning of a phrase.
### Adjuncts
Adjuncts are not an intrinsic lexical class, but a form of statives which are a distinct part of speech in their own right. Adjuncts are marked by the suffix *-a* on a stative stem.
## Function words
#### Modal clitics
Möxali inherited many of [[Xiri|Xiri's]] evidential particles, but also adopted [[Low Alöbi|Alöbi's]] strict verb-final structure in main clauses. This forced the evidentials in front of the verb, occupying the same position as the [[Xiri]] modal particle which was rarely used in conjunction with an evidential. The result is the merging of the evidentials and four of the [[Xiri]] irrealis moods (subjunctive, permissive, conditional, interrogative) into a single paradigm. 

Modal particles act as phrase-initial clitics; their syntactic position is always at the start of a phrase, but they are pronounced like a prefix on the following word, and can affect the pronunciation of that word according to the sandhi rules established [[Möxali#Vowel sandhi|above]].

The set of moods and their usage varied throughout the history and dialectology of Möxali. In most Inner Möxali writing, a total of nine clitics are identified, shown in the table below.

| Mood               | -   | Clitic  | Description                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------ | --- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Visual sensory     | -   | \|mu-\| | First hand report, visual witness or experience                                                                                  |
| Non-visual sensory | -   | \|se-\| | First hand report, non-visual witness e.g. heard or felt                                                                         |
| Inferential        | -   | \|ko-\| | First hand report, inferred from available information but not directly sensed                                                   |
| Reportative        | -   | \|pe-\| | Second hand report, quote, or untrustworthy information                                                                          |
| Narrative          | -   | \|ge-\| | Third hand report, statements "said to be" true in general by people or belief assumed to be held by the listener, unevidenced   |
| Subjunctive        | -   | \|u-\|  | Optative or exhortative when used as an independent clause, otherwise has a variety of uses as a dependent of an indicative verb |
| Permissive         | -   | \|ax-\| | Permitted or declared possible by speaker                                                                                        |
| Conditional        | -   | \|qa-\| | Dependent on a conditional, typically present as an adjunct to the verb                                                          |
| Interrogative      | -   | \|xa-\| | Questioning the listener                                                                                                         |

A single modal clitic can serve to introduce several verb phrases, but unlike [[Xiri]], there is no unmarked indicative mood, meaning evidentiality is necessarily expressed for an indicative verb. Until a new modal particle is used, every verb phrase will be assumed to be in the grammatical mood previously established by the speaker.

Many of these clitics were not common in ordinary speech and some were not used at all in most dialects, while others were essentially equivalent. For example *se-* and *ko-* were often used in overlapping roles and *pe-* and *ge-* became completely interchangeable in Outer Möxali dialects.
### Prepositions
All prepositions in Möxali are monosyllabic and always unstressed, appearing at the start of a noun phrase, so can be thought of as clitics. 
### Conjunctions
A small set of conjunctions is used to link clauses or begin statements:
- *i* — basic positive conjunction meaning "and, thus, so, then"
- *fi* — basic negative conjunction meaning "but, however, regardless"
- *dúbi* —
