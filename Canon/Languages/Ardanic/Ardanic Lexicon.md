# Structure of the Lexicon
This is a semantic lexicon, which is structured by categories, such as "kinship terms" or "humans, professions", "tools, products" or "nature (places)". This sort of thing is very intuitive for nouns and most nouns can be sorted easily into either of these categories. For verbs the distinction is more difficult and in need of explanation. Verbal categories are "movement", "body functions", "interaction, instrumentation" or "transfer". Thus some of these categories largely map on to stereotypically transitive or intransitive verbs (if the category exists). Adjectives and adverbs are categorised into "qualities", "quanitites", "dimensions" and "colours". 

Headwords are in English and represent roots, both native and foreign. If there is more than one root with similar semantics, they will receive and index. Thus **mother (1)** is the native root *nama*, while **mother (2)** could be a loaned form *munye*. 

Each headword lists all attested forms known in the different members of the Ardanic family and a possible reconstructed form from Proto-Ardanic or even Proto-Macro-Ardanic. In the case of loanwords they will have fewer attestations and no reconstructed proto form, unless it can be reasoned that the loanword entered the vocabulary at an early date. 

The attested forms will have a brief explanation of the semantics, if they differ from the meaning of the headword itself. Furthermore derived forms will be listed as well. To also show the grammatical pecularities of Ardanic, each form also has information on the word class and the vowel class, as well as the verb class in the case of verbs.
