Ardanic is a language family spoken in southwestern [[Oksandanderi]]. The most prominent member of this family is [[Classical Ardanic]], which is used as the official literary language of the [[Tyon-Arat]], the largest Ardanic speaking state. 
The structure of Ardanic as a family is less like a tree and more like an onion, so to speak. It has its core members and a periphery, which are connected by transitional dialects. Apart from Core Ardanic, there are the peripherical dialect groups referred to as Northern Ardanic, Transfsikay and Murfa Ardanic. 
For the grammar of Ardanic, please consult the article on the Classical Ardanic language. 

## Core Ardanic 
Core Ardanic is spoken by the inhabitants of the [[Ardanic Basin]] and thus it is the most widely spoken Ardanic language with the highest number of speakers. It is also the Ardanic language with the strongest literary tradition (while some peripherical languages are almost unwritten). 

The main variant of Core Ardanic is Classical Ardanic, which is based on the dialect of [[Tyeleš]] and [[Ksuray]] of the [[3rd century|3rd]] and [[4th century]]. There is another older written form of Ardanic called [[Old Ardanic]], which mainly represents the speech of [[Alpa]]. They are mostly separated by the foundation of the [[Tyon-Arat]] and the standardisation of the [[Ardanic alphabet]]. 

Core Ardanic itself can be separated into several smaller dialects, which are mainly differentiated by their phonological differences, as well as some vocabulary. These vernaculars are the dialects of Kselki, Alpa, the eastern dialect, the dialect of Tyeleš and Ksuray, the southern dialect, the Ičap dialect, the Tfa dialect, the Fsikay dialect and lastly the Očew dialect, which is known to be a transitional form to Northern Ardanic.
