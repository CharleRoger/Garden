This document goes over the phonology, grammar, and syntax of Proto-Lụnnas. For the lexicon, see [[Proto-Lụnnas Nominal Lemmas]], [[Proto-Lụnnas Verbal Lemmas]].

# Phonology
## Vowels
Proto-Lụnnas is reconstructed to have 8 distinct vowels, 3 of which are emphatic vowels. Emphatic vowels are vowels with a floating consonant feature preceding them. Phonetically they were realized similarly to their regular counterparts. \*ị tended to impart palatalization, \*ụ tended to impart labialization, and \*ạ tended to impart pharyngealization.
```
     -----Front------  ------Back------
     Regular Emphatic  Regular Emphatic
High *i      *ị        *u      *ụ
 Mid *ɛ                *ɔ
 Low *a                        *ạ
```

The emphatic vowels merged with their regular counterparts in many branches. \*u and \*ụ and \*i and \*ị merging occured more often than \*a and \*ạ.
	
## Consonants
Proto-Lụnnas is reconstructed to have 17 consonants. A few pairs of consonants merged in various branches, namely \*tt, \*c, and \*k, \*h₁ and \*š, \*ll and \*y, and \*h₁ and \*h₂. The consonants \*nn, \*tt, \*ss, and \*ll were geminate forms of \*n, \*t, \*s, and \*l, respectively. They tend to occur only in coda, where the following syllable has no onset, except in a few roots (...). The consonant \*h₁ is a dorsal fricative of some sort. \*h₁ merging with \*š in some branches implies it to possibly have some sort of palatal realization. \*h₂ is a laryngeal fricative of some sort, most likely either \[ħ\] or \[h\]. \*š was a palatal fricative, and \*c was either a palatovelar stop, a palatal stop, or a palatal affricate of some kind. A chart:
```
            Labial  Coronal           Palatal  Dorsal  Laryngeal
                    Regular Geminate 
      Nasal *m      *n      *nn
       Stop         *t      *tt       *c       *k
  Fricative *f      *s      *ss       *š       *h₁     *h₂
Approximant         *l      *ll       *y
      Trill         *r
```

The consonants \*m, \*n, \*l, \*r, or \*f may serve as a syllable nucleus (written \*ḿ \*ń \*ĺ \*ŕ f́. Syllables where these consonants are the nucleus are heavily restricted in syllable size, onset consonants, coda consonants, and consonant clusters.

## Syllable Structure
The syllable structure of Proto-Lụnnas is reconstructed to be a maximum of {s}CVCCC. From least to most sonorous, the order of consonants was /\*s/ > /\*t \*tt \*k/ > /\*c/ > /\*f \*ss \*š \*h₂/ > /\*m \*n \*nn/ > /\*l ll \*y \*r/ > /\*h₁/. Onsets occur from least sonorous to most sonorous, and codas occur vice versa. Geminate consonants never occurred in onset, and palatal and laryngeal consonants never occurred in coda.

Syllables with a syllabic consonant had a maximum syllable size of CVC. Consonants of the same place of articulation could not occur as onsets or codas in these syllables. Approximants and trills also never occurred as onsets or codas in these syllables.

The following is a table of consonant clusters. To save space, no consonants can cluster with \*h₂ or any of the geminates, so they have been omitted from the chart.
```
    -m -f -n -t -s -r -c -š -y -k -h₁
 m-        +        +  +     +     +
 f-  +     +  +  +  +  +     +  +  +
 n-           +                    
 t-              +  +     +  +
 s-  +  +  +  +              +  +
 l-           +                 +
 r-  +  +  +  +  +        +     +
 c-  +  +                          +
 š-           +     +  +        +
 k-        +  +  +  +  +     +
h₁-        +  +        +        +
```

Multiple consonants could cluster as long as they obeyed the sonority hierarchy and each set of consonants were allowed (\*-rts- is legal as both \*rt and \*-ts- are legal).
 
# Nominals
Nominals in Proto-Lụnnas were words serving as both nouns and adjectives. They could serve as the predicate in some sentences, specifically copular sentences. Instead of having a dedicated stative copula, Proto-Lụnnas put the subject and object next to each other. Nominals inflected only for number, but had a complex series of particles to mark the nominal's role in the sentence and an extensive derivation system.
Nominals had three stem types, *ị-stem*, *ụ-stem*, and *ạ-stem*. These types are named after the vowel which appeared in the number suffixes. The number suffixes very slightly depending on what stem type the nominal is.
For derivation, see [[Proto-Lụnnas Derivational Suffixes]].

## Number
Nominals declined for 4 numbers: Singular, Dual, Paucal, and Plural. The singular specified a single thing, the dual speified exactly two things, but was also used frequently as a productive form of derivation to turn nominals which usually either didn't inflect for number or inflected exclusively in the plrual into a more concrete or religious meaning.
```
           ị-stem  ụ-stem  ạ-stem
Singular                   *-ạ-Ø
    Dual   *-ị-s   *-ụ-s   *-ạ-y
  Paucal   *-ị-ya  *-ụ-ya  *-ạ-kụ
  Plural   *-ị-re  *-ụ-n   *-ạ-cɛ
```

## Derivation
## Role Marking
Nominal role marking in Proto-Lụnnas was done using a system of particles. Each of these had an alternative topic-marking form where the noun was placed at the front of the clause wit h this particle. The regular particles went after the noun, but the topic marking particles went before the noun. These particles marked the subject, simple object, and complex object. The simple object is a role which is only used by verbs which take two objects. The complex object is a role which is used by all transitive verbs, and can take prepositional particles. A list of particles:
```
Particle  Topic-marking  Meaning/Function
          ya             Marks the subject of the sentence
nɔ        anụ            Marks the complex object of the sentence
nɛ        cɛ             Marks the simple object of the sentence
in        in             Marks the complex object as "From X"
yi        si             Marks the complex object as "of X"
kụ        akạ            Marks the complex object as a locative
```
## Pronouns
Pronouns om Proto-Lụnnas were nominals which were used as stand-ins for other nominals. Simple pronouns marked only the subject of a clause, the possessor of another noun (coming after the possessum), or the prepositional complex object of a clause, and differentiated between all four nominal numbers (singular, dual, paucal, and plural). Complex pronouns were pronouns which marked both the subject and non-prepositional complex object. A list of simple pronouns:
```
          1pos     2pos   3apos     3ipos
Singular  *ah₁a    *mi    *h₂at     *ša
    Dual  *ah₁ạy   *mịs   *h₂atịs   *šạy
  Paucal  *ah₁ạkụ  *mịya  *h₂atịya  *šạkụ
  Plural  *ah₁ạcɛ  *mịre  *h₂atịre  *šạcɛ
```
Complex pronouns took a root depending on the subject, and a suffix based on the object. Both subject and object only differentiated between two of the nominal numbers, singular and plural:
```
SBJ        OBJ
1sg  ah₁-  1sg -(h₁)a
1pl ah₁ạ-  1pl -(a)cɛ
2sg   mi-  2sg -(i)yạ
2pl   mị-  2pl -(i)rɛ
3as h₂at-  3as -(a)t
3is   ša-  3is -(a)y
3ap h₂ạt-  3ap -(ị)r
3ip   šạ-  3ip -(ɛ)
```
For example, "*I recently looked for it*" would have been *\***ah₁ɛ** iyạ kɛšuh₁ạs,* or "*They(pl) were recently fixing you*"" would have been *\***h₂atiyạ** cɛtti*

### Interrogative Pronouns
The base root for all interrogative pronouns in Proto-Lụnnas was *\*h₂-*. This root took different stem vowels to determine more specific meaning. The following is a chart of basic interrogative pronouns:
```
(ạ-stem) inanimate  :   *h₂-ạ      what
(ị-stem) animate    :   *h₂-ị      who
(ụ-stem) nonsingular:   *h₂-ụ-s    what/who dual
                        *h₂-ụ-ya   what/who paucal
                        *h₂-ụ-n    what/who plural
```

Questions asking *"Who is"* or *"What is"* were phrased the exact same as with other pronouns. For example, *\*fannạ h₁ạ* for "What is a tree?" (lit. "tree what")
# Verbs
Verbs served as words denoting an action or event. Verbs required at least a subject. Verbs conjugated for tense, aspect, and mood. Proto-Lụnnas had the three tenses past, near-past, and non-past. Verbs conjugated for aspect in the form of perfective and imperfective, and for mood in the form of realis, irrealis, and interrogative. The interrogative functioned less as a mood in its own right, but more so as a modifier of the clause. The interrogative was marked with the particle *\*ɔ* at the beginning of the clause the verb is in. Verbs are in the realis mood by default, but the particle *\*ɛn* could be placed after the verb to mark it as non-interrogative irrealis. The perfective aspect was marked with the particle *\*iyạ* before the verb, and the imperfective was unmarked. The past tense was marked with the particle *\*ir* before the verb, the nonpast with *\*sɔs* before the verb, and the near-past was the default.
The various combinations of aspect and mood probably led to various meanings, but nothing is consistent among descendants.
The particle *sun* at the front of the clause turns it into a modifier of the previous clause indicating that the first clause occured while the second one did, or as a result of the second clause.

# Syntax
Proto-Lụnnas had a simple clausal system. Clauses consisted of at least a subject nominal and a verb. The subject could have served as both the subject and complex object of a clause. Clauses had at most two objects: the complex object and simple object. The complex object was the primary object that all transitive verbs used. Ditransitive verbs used the simple object as an additional parameter. Complex objects could be prepositional or non-prepositional. Prepositional objects took a role-marking particle which both marked a noun as the object and served as prepositions. Non-prepositional objects also took a role-marking particle, except it did not serve as a preposition, and only served to denote that the nominal is the complex or simple object. The subject and simple objects could only be non-prepositional. All role-marking particles had an alternate topic-fronting variant, that put the nominal at the very front of the clause and marked the nominal as being the topic of the clause. The word order, barring topic fronting, is Subject-Verb-Object.
