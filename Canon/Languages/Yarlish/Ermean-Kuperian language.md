The language of the regions of [[Erme]] and the [[Kuperi]] is a close relative of [[Kathurn language|Kathurn]], which is spoken within the central regions of the [[Yarlish Lowlands]] and Midlands. In some ways Ermean is the older language and the [[Stele of Iskuld of Erme]] composed in [[5th century BGS|480 BGS]] is the oldest known text in a Yarlish language and the oldest piece of literature in the whole of [[Oksandanderi]]. Early Ermean flourished alongside the [[Kingdom of Erme and Vukhun]] and became sidelined when [[VÃ«rev]] became the dominant state in the Lowlands. 

The actual Ermean corpus that predates [[Kathurn language|Kathurn]] is quite small and Kathurn was used as literary standard within Erme for most of its history as well. The main differences between Ermean and Kathurn-proper do not appear within the logographic script, but become apparent in syllabograms, which can different a lot from each other.
