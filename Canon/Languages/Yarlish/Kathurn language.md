Kathurn is a Yarlish language, which functioned as the literary language of the [[Yarlish Lowlands]] from the [[2nd century BGS]] onwards. Kathurn was a spoken language until the [[5th century|5th]] or [[6th century]] and then gradually developed into successor language. It remained the literary standard for several centuries and only got replaced piece by piece by written vernacular languages during the [[Empire of Kalotgane]] in the [[12th century]]. 
The spoken variety of Kathurn is sometimes called [[Central Yarlish]], while Kathurn is only the name of the literary language. In common usage both are used almost synonymously. This grammar aims to detail both the grammar of Kathurn itself, as that of Central Yarlish and make reference to the related Ermean-Kuperian language, which is undoubtly influenced by Kathurn, as it takes it as its literary form as well. 
# History 

## First Attestations
The written history of [[Yarlish languages]] is generally estimated to begin in the [[8th century BGS]] in a time period called the [[History of Oksandanderi#Formative-Literary Period (700 - 300 BGS)|Formative-Literary]] lasting from around 700 BGS till 300 BGS. Prior to this, in the Oksandanderian bronze age, seal stamps and numerical tablets with purchases and such. While it can be argued that a person using a seal with a [[Mabur]] or deer on it, might have *mabur* in their personal name. Evidence for more and more linguistic information increases as we approach the 700 BGS mark. Another problem is that a lot of seals are mass produced and lack variety. They represent maybe a dozen or so merchant families or temple authorities per city. While they are many, they don't reveal much information. 

After the 700 BGS mark we see linguistic information being put into the forefront. While the majority of documents are still stamps, receipts of transactions and taxes, they feature lines of text which state what the matter is about. Also we see names spelled out in two or three glyphs. This format will be kept for the next several thousand years. Texts of the early period read as such: 

"Kahas has bought thirty Mabur and brought them to his home in Vërev"  (monetary transactions)
"Yalkhalbiye was born to Abnam and Salmemna"  (records of births)
"Astras was found guilty and will be killed" (court rulings)

What these texts lack is a lot of phonetic information. While names and certain suffixes are from time to time rendered phonetically, most verbs are generic and can actually be a range of things. Additionally non-final suffixes are often not paid much attention to. For this reason the above sentences are only rendered in translation and not in original language. 
## Old Ermean
In the year [[6th century BGS]] the cities of [[Erme]] and [[Vukhun]] form the [[Kingdom of Erme and Vukhun]], which is generally held to be the first proper kingdom in Oksandanderi. Some of it plays into the matter of the [[Kost-Kort Conflicts]] between priesthood and military aristocracy, which formed as this time too. 
However after the death of the second king of both cities, a stele was erected to commemorate the death of the ruler. These stele is widely held to be the oldest complete narrative text in Oksandanderi. However there are other contenders, like the [[Stele of the Teacher]], common opinion dictates that the king takes priority. 

The language of the stele is generally called Old Ermean, which is an older version of the [[Ermean-Kuperian language]], a closely related sister-language to Kathurn. In the following century many more linguistic monuments appear, which can be classified as belonging to this dialect. During this early period, Ermean seems to have been the literary standard instead of [[Central Yarlish]], to which Kathurn belongs. 
## Early Kathurn 
Around the [[4th century BGS]] there is a shift both in politics and language. For one the [[Kost-Kort Conflicts]] have been resolved and the military aristocracy has won in most city state, which now have become proper monarchies, with a theocracy being only intact in a few places, most notably [[Imnagal]], which is hailed as the last priestly city. 

Furthermore as more attention is put on the central Lowlands, its kings feel the need to immortalise themselves more and more. The format of the royal stele has become a mainstay and each king has at least several made throughout their reign, some even each year to detail their exploits. This is copied by the lower nobility, which begin to emulate this trend. In this period we also find the first attestations of poetry. Aristocrats, priests and rich patricians alike begin to fashion their grave sites with small poems expressing grief and joy about their passing. 
Temple walls are also decorated with such poems, expressing dedication and veneration to spirits, ancestors and believes. 
## Astmergian Reforms 
The so called [[History of Oksandanderi#City-State Period (300 BGS - 164 AGS)|City-state period]] lasts until [[2nd century|164 AGS]] when [[Astmerge the Great]] conquers most of Oksandanderi. With his conquest he also establishes a new bureaucracy for his empire. With this new bureaucracy also a new written standard comes into being. Previously basically every city state had their own way of writing and their own glyph shapes. Astmerge unifies this and the corresponding changes are propagates through his system of "colonial cities". 
# Phonology
The phonology of Kathurn differentiates six short vowels and three long vowels, as well as fiveteen consonants. The complexity of the phonemic system lies in its morphophonological changes. Some of these changes are peculiar to the Kathurn, while others are found in all of [[Central Yarlish]].
## Vowels 
The vocalic system of Kathurn is asymmetric and differentiates six short vowels, them being /a, e, i, o, u, ə/ and three long vowels /e:, a:, u:/. There are more long vowels, which are the result of allophonic processes. Regular phonemic long vowels are fewer not just in the vocalic system itself, but also in their overall distribution within the vocabulary. No native roots contain two long vowels. The majority of long vowels are on monosyllabic roots, although they also occur on bisyllabic roots.
Kuperian has one short vowel less, the /ə/ merged with /i/, resulting in words like /tamə/ "blood" corresponding to Kuperian /dami/.
The purely phonemic inventory of Kathurn looks as such: 

| Front | Central | Back  |
| ----- | ------- | ----- |
| i     |         | u, u: |
| e:    | ə       | o     |
| ɛ     |         |       |
|       | a, a:   |       |
Long vowels which are the result of allophony are a lot more common and do frequently occur in speech. Thus also includes derived and inflected stems with more than one long vowel. If one adds all allophonic long vowels into the system, we are left with a system of seven short vowels and six long vowels. This count does not include the six possible nasal vowels, which are also a product of allophony. 

| Front | Central | Back  |
| ----- | ------- | ----- |
| i, i: |         | u, u: |
| e, e: | ə       | o, o: |
| ɛ, ɛ: |         |       |
|       | a, a:   |       |
### Nasal vowels
Nasalisation is a feature of Kathurn which is never phonemic. Nasalisation is essentially caused by the same morphophonological processes, which are also responsible for lenition and lengthening.
## Consonants
The phonological inventory of Kathurn is likewise fairly simple. There are overall only 14 phonemic consonants. Additionally some of them are fairly restricted in their distribution. Voiced strops, as well as /r/ and /l/ and the nasal /n/ can never appear as word initial onsets in native roots.

|             | Labial | Dental | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar |
| ----------- | ------ | ------ | -------- | ------- | ----- |
| Stop        | p, b   | t, d   |          |         | k, g  |
| Fricative   | v      |        | s        |         | x     |
| Nasal       | m      |        | n        |         |       |
| Trill       |        |        | r        |         |       |
| Approximant |        |        |          | j       |       |
| Lateral     |        |        | l        |         |       |
Then, like in the case of vowels, there are a lot of allophonic variations to consonants. They fall into the pattern of lenition and lowering (also strengthening). The exact allophones are not uniform per dialect and the allophones shown do specifically represent Kathurn. Some dialects for example express lenition by affricatisation in alveolars, which results in /t/ becoming /tʃ/.
Adding possible allophonies into the system, it grows to at least 

|             | Labial | Dental | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Glottal |
| ----------- | ------ | ------ | -------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
| Stop        | p, b   | t, d   |          |         | k, g  |         |
| Fricative   | f, v   | θ, ð   | s        |         | x, ɣ  | h       |
| Nasal       | m      |        | n        |         | ŋ     |         |
| Trill       |        |        | r        |         |       |         |
| Approximant |        |        |          | j       |       |         |
| Lateral     |        |        | l        |         |       |         |
### Voiceless Stops
Voiceless stops are not aspirated and can be phonetically identical to voiced stops in coda position. Especially in intervocalic position after open syllables, voiceless stops are realised as \[b̥, d̥, ɡ̊]. 
### Voiced Stops
Voiced stops on the other hand cannot appear word initially, this limitation might be due to a vanishing contrast between these two categories as stops. Strangely though the constrast, although not phonetically distinctive, is retained phonemically in codas. Codaic consonants like /t/ and /d/ remain distinct even if they are both realised as \[t].

In Upper Midlands variants voiced stops are, even without morphophonological weakening, fricativised. This process can result in \[bv, dð, gɣ] or even \[v, ð, ɣ]. Eastern variants, in particular Kuperian and extending into Ermean show nasalisation in voiced stops, leading to \[mb, nd, ŋg]. This effect is strengthened by long vowels. After a long vowel final voiced stops are realised as nasals. In Kuperian this change has become phonemic, where initial /b/ became /v/, but /m/ after long vowels, resulting in /paːmi/ "mouth", contrasting with Kathurn /paːbə/, but Kathurn /mari/ "older sister" going back to Proto-Lowland Yarlish /bari/, which is /va(r)ʒ/ in Kuperian. The change of final voiced consonants to nasal is a typical development in later Ermean-Kuperian, while Central Yarlish, including Makhatdurn, proceed to merge voiced and voiceless consonants.
## Morphophonology 
One of the most important characteristics of Kathurn, and Lowland Yarlish, grammar in general are the various morphohonological processes which are at play. There are in total three variants, lenition, lowering and strengthening. Lenition makes vowels long and stops fricatives, while lowering lowers vowels and makes obstruents voiceless. Strengthening creates either geminates or makes nasal into prenasalised voiced stops. The exact realisation of each phoneme within a certain context can vary too. As already mentioned, one noteworthy difference is wether /t/ and /d/ become interdental fricatives or affricates. It is noteworthy that these processes are commonly found within nominal morphology, as well as derivational suffixes, but not within verbal morphology. Being basic to all of Lowland Yarlish it points at a difference in the age of verbal and nominal morphology.

The object of each process is the last segment prior to the attaching suffix. In cases of prefixation (Which is rare and mostly consists of semi-compounds), the first element of the preceding stem is subject to change. If the affected element is elided, the corresponding change does not change place, but disappears. This is not the case in vowel replacement though. This contrasts with morphophonology in Ermean-Kuperian, where entire syllables are affected.
### Lenition
Lenition is a process which turns stops into fricatives and short vowels into long vowels. This means turning /p/ into /f/ and /b/ into /v/. In Kathurn the coronal consonants /t/ and /d/ become /θ/ and /ð/ respectively. In variants, where /t/ and /d/ are not realised as dentals, but alveolar they become \[tʃ] and \[dʒ] instead. Final lenitated /d/ can also be glottalised and appear as [ʔ] or not at all.

Vowels are lengthened regardless of their quality before, but for /ə/. An /ɛ/ becomes /ɛː/ and not /eː/, distinguishing natural and lenitioned long vowels from each other. This differentiation does extend to other vowels though. The exception is /ə/, which becomes /eː/. There is also a secondary effect, which turns final voiced stops (plus /v/) into nasals. This effect appears if the last segment is a nasal. The nasalisation is essentially "stretched" and affects the final stop. Vocalic suffixes which leniated and attach to nasal consonants are also nasalised.

Fricatives behave differently. /x/ is not affected at all, while /s/ is debuccalised into /h/. The labial /v/ is canonically leniated to /f/ in Kathurn, but has different variants in other dialects of Central Yarlish. There is is debuccalised progressively and can range from \[ʋ] to \[ɦ] or \[h].

Some peculiar to Ermean-Kuperian is that /r/ can also be affected by lenition, turning into \[ʒ].

| Plain    | p   | t     | k   | b   | d     | g   | v       | s   | x   |
| -------- | --- | ----- | --- | --- | ----- | --- | ------- | --- | --- |
| Lenition | f   | θ     | x   | v   | ð     | ɣ   | f       | h   | x   |
| Nasal    |     |       |     | m   | n     | ŋ   | m       |     |     |
| Variant  |     | tʃ, ʔ |     |     | dʒ, ʔ |     | ʋ, ɦ, h |     |     |

|          | a   | ɛ   | i   | o   | u   | ə   |
| -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lenition | a:  | ɛː  | i:  | o:  | u:  | eː  |
| Nasal    | ã   | ɛ̃  | ĩ   | õ   | ũ   | ẽ  |
Suffixes which cause lenition and contain a vowel lose that vowel upon contact with a vowel final base. 
Lenition causing suffixes are indicated through the abbreviation \[len]
### Lowering
Lowering is a process, which lowers vowels and voiced consonants. Thus naturally it does not affect already voiced consonants. Likewise the low vowel /a/ is also excluded from this process. Among consonants the sibilant /s/ is noteworthy for turning into a rhotic /r/.

| Plain   | p   | t   | k   | s   | x   |
| ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lowered | p   | d   | g   | r   | ɣ   |

| Plain   | ɛ   | i   | o   | u   | ə   | e:  | u:  |
| ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lowered | a   | e   | a   | o   | ɛ   | ɛː  | o:  |
Lowering causing suffixes are indicated through the abbreviation \[low]
### Strengthening
The third morphophonological process is called strengthening. It is also the least common one and affects the least phonemes. Strengthening makes voiced consonants voiceless, voiceless consonants geminates. Fricatives become suffricate clusters and nasal become prenasalised stops or clusters of nasal and voiced stops. Strengthening affects vowels only in the matter that they become unaffected by syncope. If a strengthening suffix begins with a vowel, this vowel replaces a previous base-final vowel. 

| Plain  | p   | t   | k   | b   | d   | g   | v   | s   | x   | m   | n   |
| ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Strong | pp  | tt  | kk  | p   | t   | k   | fp  | ss  | xk  | mb  | nd  |
Strengthening causing suffixes are indicated through the abbreviation \[str]
## Phonotactics
The maximal syllable structure in Kathurn is CVCC. The minimal is just V, although V in itself is rare and even monovocalic stems like _a-_ "to go" and _o-_ "to touch" appear most of the time as VC with some consonantal suffix. The most common monovocalic words are _e_ "big" and the interrogative particle _é._ There is a general bias for codas in Kathurn, as there are no onset clusters, but a variety of possible coda clusters. This continues the same trend that does allow for voicing contrast in onsets, but contrasts them in codas.
### Onsets 
Out of the total phonological inventory, there is only a limited number of phonemes that can stand initially in a syllable in Kathurn and Central Yarlish in general. In Kathurn in particular only /p, t, k, v, s, x, m, j/ can make up the onsets of word initial syllables. In Ermean-Kuperian voiced stops are permissable as onsets, adding /b, d, g/ to the list. As for the whole of Lowland Yarlish /n, r, l/ cannot stand as word initial onsets. In Vándurn /n/ is a viable onset , but still /r/ and /l/ are not found. This limitation is more widespread in the whole of Oksandanderi and shared with the Ardanic language family.

As for vowel initial syllables all vowels but /u/ are commonly found. The only exception is /u/, which never appears word initially, but for loanwords and the second person pronoun _ukha._

Medial onsets are treated differently and allow for the full range of onsets, including voiced stops and /n/.
### Nuclei
Only vowels can make up nuclei in Kathurn, there are no diphthongs nor syllabic consonants.

Some varieties show epenthetic /ə/ in cases, where a cluster can be avoided. This is especially common in later variants, which transition into [[Pikhanderidušun]]. 
### Medial Clusters
There are no complex clusters in initial onsets, but there are otherwise illicit clusters containing /r/ found in medials. These are combinations of voiced stops and the rhotic, such as *andra* "valley" or *idra* "grain". 

### Codas
The most variety between different phonemes in Kathurn is actually shown in coda. Voiceless and voiceless stops are consistently distinguished in codaic position, that is phonologically. In most dialects, especially western dialects, they tend to be phonetically identically. This statement relies mostly on later mergers though. As for Kathurn, final \[t] and final \[d] might very well be contrastive. More likely though is a scenario in which final \[t] is contrasted to final \[nd], as final \[d] lacking any additional aspiration contrast, was not contrastive enough. Successive changes in the phonological system of Yarlish point into this direction. More than the contrast of bare codas however there is the contrast of coda clusters, of which there are many.
All valid codas in Kathurn as as follows. 

|     | p   | t   | k   | b   | d   | g   | v   | s   | x   | m   | n   | r   | j   | l   |

| n   |     |     |     |     |     |     |     | -ns |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| r   | -rp | -rt | -rk | -rb | -rd | -rg | -rv | -rs | -rx | -rm | -rn |     |     | -rl |

| l   | -lp | -lt | -lk | -lb | -ld | -lg | -lv | -ls | -lx | -lm | -ln |     |     |     |
## Vowel contraction
Vowel contraction is usually regressive in nature and favours suffix vowels over stem vowels (with exceptions). This pattern is exceptionless with suffixes causing strengthening. Their vowels are considered strong. With suffixes causing lenition it is the reverse. Suffix-internal vowels are only retained if the stem ends in a consonant. 

Prefixed vowels usually do not contract nor replace following vowels. They are the same phonological word and are only differentiated from their base through a small hiatus. In careful speech, speakers insert glides following /i, e, u, o/ final prefixes. Such as *eárv* being \[ɛja:rv] "big house" or *oís* being \[oʋi:ʃ] "compatriot"
## Consonant assimilation

## Clitisation 
Clitisation can happen within verbal and nominal phrases, especially set phrases like personal names and titles. 
There are both proclitics and enclitics. Most of these are "weak words", which are without exception monosyllabic and mostly have a V or CV structure. Another factor which attracts clitisation is if a vowel-final word and a consonant initial or a consonant final and vowel initial word appear together. 
Most words prone to clitisation are common adjectives, the numeral së "one" and particles. 
## Syncope
Syncope is the phonemon of delition or reduction of vowels in even syllables and the weakening of some consonants around them. 

## Romanisation
Romanisation takes into account both phonemes and their allophones, that means that the realisation of /t/ as \[θ] is given as \<th> instead of just \<t>. The same goes for nasalisation of /b/ and /d/, but not /g/, which is just written as \<g>. If there is a variant, like \/d/ becoming \[dʒ] instead of \[ð], it is still written as \<dh>. 
The vowel quality of  \[ɛ] is not differentiated from \[e] graphically either, both are \<e>. The same goes for nasal vowels, which are not written if there is no consontal nasalisation going on as well. 
To distinguish vocalic prefixes, it is possible to use a hyphen to separate them i.e. *e-árv* or *eárv* "big house" are both valid.

# Word Classes 

Kathurn has nouns and verbs as its main word classes. There are several verbalising and nominalising derivative suffixes. 

(As a general tendency, verbs tend to also be nouns or can be zero derived, while nouns need verbalising suffixes to act as verbs. Thus deverbal suffixes cannot be used on nouns, while denominal suffixes tend to have a limited usage on verbs as well. Several deverbal suffixes actually use verbalised nominal stems as base, even if the derived base verb itself, does not exist)

Apart from this there is a limited number of adjectives, adjectives, quantifiers and particles. 
# Word Formation 

## Compounding
Compounding is a productive process in Kathurn. The majority of compounds are of the Noun-Noun type. Morphophonologically there are three types. Leniating compounds, lowering compounds and neutral compounds.
### Qualitative compounds
The type of Qualitative compounds is a closed class of Adjective-Noun compounds, which leniated the head of the compound. The adjectival quality consists of forms like *ka-* "clear, good", *su-* "enduring", *va-* "bad", *te-* "hostile", *kap-* "central", *e-* "large, big", *ke-* "great, expansive, big", *mo-* "wide", *pi-* "low, at". The adjectives used in these compounds straddle the boundary between true compounds and prefixes.

The underlying adjectives are considered *weak words* which are often proclitics, but can be considered syntactically independent as proper adjectives. 
This becomes visible if they are taken apart. While *e arv* \[ɛ.arv] "big house" might be considered a compound, the adjective can be placed before a numeral resulting in *e së arv* \[ɛ.sə arv] "one big house". In these cases the adjective is a proclitic, but it does not case lenition on the numeral. Only cases in which lenition takes place, these combinations are truly one word. 

Due to the close semantic proximity there are few profound minimal pairs between adjective+noun
compounds and adjective and noun combinations of this type. One being *tekhort* \[tɛxort] "enemy king" and *te kort* \[tɛɡ̊ort] "hostile king" or *kakhort* \[kaxort] "great-king" (supreme ruler) and *ka kort* \[kaɡ̊ort] "great king" (good ruler). Note that in the examples, the adjective is phonologically a proclitic, but the actual consonant mutation is caused by compounding only. Some of these adjectival compounds only appear in compounds, such as *pi-* "low, at", while its almost synonymous counterpart *kër-* "low" can appear as both.
### Genitival compounds
Another group of compounds causes lowering to the head. These are genitival compounds, which express a possessive-like relation. The easiest form of this relation is possible possession itself. Such as the term *andragort* "lord of the valley" or *arvgas* "customary law". 
The relations between inanimates are different in that they often depict either something which can be found somewhere, such as *vingalb* "water flower". This relation can also be more abstract than simple placement. Thus *suhadiganda* "land of everlasting spring" is such an example.
The next category conceived by this pattern are part-whole relations. Thus énes \[e:neʃ] "kinfolk",
consisting of *én* "people" and *is* "human being". This part-whole relation can also be reversed, in which the genitival compound conceives the individual entities out of which something is made, such as *arvdur* "city/herd of houses" or *oksandan* "orchard of fruit trees".
### Appositional compounds
Adpositional compounds are compounds which are formed by two equal parts. Appositional compounds can be rephrased into statements of "X is Y". One example being *vitvin* "saltwater" or "salty water". The ambiguity of vit between "salt" and "salty" is not important in this case, as the difference between adjectives and nouns is rather shallow in many cases. Appositional can be considered similar to qualitative compounds with the difference being that they cause no morphophonemic changes and qualitative compounds are considered a closed class.
### Verbal Compounds
Verbs like other word classes can form compounds. These compounds come in three variants. qualitative compounds, noun+verb compounds and verb+verb compounds. In terms of morphophonemics, noun+verb compounds are usually marked like genitival nominal compounds, while verb+verb behave neutral. Qualitative verbal compounds behave like nominal qualitative compounds. Verbal compounds are less common than nominal compounds. The most common form of verbal compounds are qualitative compounds. Noun+verb compounds come in the form of verbs which take an internal object. This object can be considered direct or indirect. Kathurn does not show productive incorporation and the difference in meaning between a compound and a regular object verb pair is rather shallow. Common examples are *tammos* "eat bread" which is specically used for a more elaborate meal (where bread is always a side dish) instead of just any act of eating. Bread can of course also be consumed otherwise too. An example for a compound taking an indirect object is *kedel* (*ke+tel*) "to give reverence, to pay respect, to revere". A compound like *kedel* can be used with a direct object such as *más kedel*, which
denotes a certain ritualistic performance. 

Verb+verb compounds are likely the result from fossilized converbial constructions. For example
the compound *sádkhota* (*sád+khota*) "hear-see" is used to mean "to play close attention" or *telkeri* (tel-keri) "(give+throw)" means "to throw something to someone in good will".

Lastly, **qualitative verbal compounds** are the most common and most productive form of verbal
compounds. Their meaning is also the most lexicalised and sometimes in cases like *athem* "to run" the original stem is not used without prexation anymore. Especially spatial attributes are often assigned to verbs of motion, thus *erá* "to ascend" and *kërá* "to descend". The compound form *a-* adds a sense of motion and intensity to verbs, *akhé* "to violently break apart" or *sure* "to sleep" becoming *ahure* "to go to sleep". The compound form *o-* adds saliency and volition, thus the difference between *sád* and *ohád* roughly equals "to hear" and "to listen". In motion verbs it expresses proximity *okhil* "to come closer". Others show more idiosyncratic behavior, such as *pamos* "to feast with delight".
## Derivation

### Adverbial

#### -er \[neut]
The adverbial derivational suffix *-er* forms adverbs (who would have thought). It is largely denominal, while deverbal adverbs are formed using the stative tense/aspect (aka converbs). 
There are however still several deverbal adverbs formed this way, primarily through verbs relating to the senses and bodily actions. 

*aban* "father" > *abner* "fatherly"
*alb* "day" > *alber* "daily"
*apsa* "head" > *apser* "beginning" 
*at-* "two" > *ater* "paired"
*is* "human being" > *iser* "humane"
*khele* "woman" > *kheler* "feminine"
*muni* "mother" > *muner* "motherly"
*ton* "man" > *toner* "manly"

*sád* "to hear" > *sáder* "audible"
*mos* "to eat" > *moser* "tasty"
### Abilitive

#### -sun \[neut]

*a* "to go" > *asun* "able to move"
*eys* "fire" > *eyssun* "burnable" (derived from *eyse* "to burn")
*ime* "to cook" > *imsun* "cookable, edible" 
*mos* "to eat" > *mossun* "to be hungry"
*papa* "food" > *pasun* "edible" (derived from an unattested verb)
### Agent Nouns - Occupations
There are several derivational suffixes, which express agent nouns, professions, occupations and general associations with things and acts. Some of them are denominal, some deverbal and some both. There is a large overlap between them, although in some cases they are contrastive and feature minimal pairs like *terda* "teacher" and *terti* "student", both derived from *tere* "to know, learn". 
#### -er \[neut] (m-class)
The suffix *-er* is an old and unproductive nominalising suffix. It is both deverbal and denominal. It is still found in poetic speech, as well as some old names for specific occupations, which have neither a *-do* nor *-ti* suffixed alternative. It was probably originally generalised nominalising suffix, which might be related to the individualiser *-e* 

*alm-* "peach" > *almer* "peach gardener"
*malt* "to challenge" > *malter* "challenge, test ordeal"
*vayl* "offering" > *vayler* "donor, benefactor" (poetic speech)

#### -(e)khta \[len] (human class)
The suffix *-(e)khta* is a purely denominal suffix and denotes people associated with a certain thing and can denote occupations and professions, but also general states of being. 
The suffix causes lenition. 

*ars* "clothing, textiles" > *arhekhta* "textile worker"
*arv* "house" > *arfekhta* "urbanite"
*kas* "traditional law" > *kahekhta* "tribal people"
*tan* "garden" > *tanekhta* "agriculturalist"
*tay* "field, acre" > *taykhta* "farmer"
#### -da \[neut] (human class)
The suffix *-da* itself is derived from the suffix *-do* which denotes nominal abstracts and locatives. The suffix *-do* itself is both deverbal and denominal and thus so is *-da*. Although *-da* is derived from *-do*, not all *-da* derivatives have a corresponding *-do* derivative. 
The suffix *-da* is morphophonologically neutral. 

*altën* "sun, year" > *altënda* "calendarian"
*kas* "(traditional) law" > *kasda* "someone of the law"
*mala* "deed" > *malda* "soul, drive"
*say* "joy" > *sayda* "benefactor, bringer of joy"
*tan* "garden" > *tanda* "gardener"
*tere* "to know" > *terda* "teacher"
*tun* "thunder" > *tunda* "blacksmith" 
*tur* "flock, herd" > *turda* "shepherd"
*vul* "to dig" > *vulda* "miner"
#### -dun \[neut] (human class)
The suffix *-dun* denotes people associated with a place. It is also derived from *-do* primarily in its *locative* function. 
The suffix *-da* is morphophonologically neutral. 

*andra* "valley" > *andradun* "valley people"
*Erme* "city of Erme" > *Ermedun* "Erme people"
*Oksandanderi* > *Oksandanderidun* "Oksandanderians"
#### -ti \[neut] (human class)
The suffix *-ti* is purely deverbal and denotes someone who engages into an activity. The relation to the activity can be more or less direct and some words have a slightly different meaning than the original verb. 
The suffix is morphophonologically neutral. 

*a* "to go" > *ati* "nomad"
*ayongo* "to do poetry" > *ayongoti* "poet"
*ime* "to cook" > *imti* "cook"
*malt* "to challenge" > *maltti* "combatant"
*sul* "to wither" > *sulti* "a dying person"
*sure* "to sleep" > *surti* "tired person"
*tel* "to give" > *telti* "donor" 
*tere* "to know" > *terti* "student" 
### Augmentatives - Diminutives
### Individualisers 
The term *individualiser* denotes a series of suffix, which are obligatory on so called *dependent* roots, roots which cannot appear as bare stems. These suffixes *individualise* kinds and things belonging to kinds in various ways. Individualisers are often contrastive and can denote associated objects of various size and shape. 
#### -an \[neut] (i-class)
The suffix *-an* usually individualises generally *large* and somewhat *taller* objects. Something which stands over the category it is associated. Like in the case of trees it means the plant itself. In the case of metals, it denotes ores and earths. On verbs it also acts as nominaliser. 
The suffix is morphophonologically neutral. Resulting nouns belong to the i-class. 

*alm-* "peach" > *alman* "peach tree"
*andra* "valley" > *andran* "gorge, ravine"
*imna* "daughter" > *imnan* "firstborn daughter"
*kal* "to venerate" > *kalan* "veneration"
*khis* "oil" > *khisan* "oil fruit plant"
malm- "cherry" > *malman* "cherry tree"
*mat* "gold" > *matan* "gold ore"
*mari* "older sister" > *firstborn elder sister*
*mire* "fruit" > *miran* "harvest, produce"
*min* "black, dark" > *minan* "sadness, mourning" (poetic)
*oks-* "apple-" > *oksan* "apple tree"
*part-* "bricks" > *partan* "brick wall"
*pëks* "lentils" > *pëksan* "lentil meal"
*yim* "sweet" > *yiman* "sugarcane"

Maybe Ardanic *arat* "homeland" > *ardan* "Region of Tyon-Arat"
#### -an \[str] (i-class)
Apart from the neutral *-an*, there is a second *-an* suffix, which causes strengthening. It is much rarer and can be found fossilised on several placenames. 

*alm-* "peach" > *almban* "the peach" (sometimes also a personal name)
*altën* "sun, year" > *altëndan* "the sun"
*erbe* "friend" > *Erban* (personal name) 
*pak* "copper" > Pakkan "city of Pakkan"
#### -e \[neut] (m-class)
The individualiser *-e* often, but not always, denotes smallish things associated with a larger concept. In regards to trees and crops it often denotes fruits and produce (albeit non-processed). 

*alm-* "peach" > *alme* "peach fruit"
*oks-* "apple" > *okse* "apple fruit"
*part-* "bricks" > *parte* "a brick" 

The same suffix is probably also used with numbers, where it forms a nominalised form of a number, a group of things with that quantity 

*at-* "two" > *ate* "pair" 
*kas-* "three" > *kase* "group of three"
*kem-* "five" > *keme* "group of five"
#### -u \[str] 
The suffix *-u* is called a "reification", it is not very productive, but appears on numbers and some adjectives frequently. 

With numbers it forms ordinal numbers. 
*at-* "two" > *attu* "two"
*kas-* "three" > *kassu* "three"
*mekh-* "four" > *mekhku* "four" 
*kem-* "five" > *kembu* "five"
### Negatives 
#### -yen \[neut] (i-class)
The suffix *-yen* is a negative suffix comparable to English *un-*. 

#### -yër \[neut]
The *-yër* suffix is a privative suffix, meaning "without X". 

### Nominal Abstracts - Locatives

#### -do \[neut] (i-class)
The suffix *-do* has two primary functions, for one it forms denominal abstracts and it also forms locatives. 
The suffix is primarily denominal, but also takes verbs.

**Locative usage:**
*alm-* "peach" > *almdo* "peach orchard"
*altën* "sun" > *alëndo* "within sunshine"
*andra* "valley" > *andrado* "valley, vale"
*er* "high" > *erdo* "high place, plateau"
*tav* "path, way" > *tavdo* "street"

*vul* "to dig" > *vuldo* "mine"

**Abstract concept:** 
*aban* "father" > *abando* "fatherhood"
*is* "human" > *isdo* "humanity"
*kas* "artisan" > *kasdo* "craftsmanship" 
*muni* "mother" > *mundo* "motherhood" 
*tan* "garden" > *tando* "gardenry"
*ton* "man" > *tondo* "manhood"
*yeray* "hero" > *yeraydo* "heroism"

*ké* "to break" > *kédo* "destruction"
*tere* "to know, to learn" > *terdo* "lore"
*sure* "to sleep" > *surdo* "sleep"
*virla* "to love, find attractive" > *virldo* "attraction" 

#### -eri \[str] 
The suffix *-eri* creates locative nouns, which equal "place where X is (found)". 

### Parts - Products

#### -é \[len] 
The suffix forms products made out of things, mostly edible things like fruits or grains. 
In more poetic speech it can also mean the result of actions or resulting states of mind. 

*alb* "day" > *alvé* "day's work"
*alm-* "peach" > *almé* "peach juice"
*altën* "sun, year" > *altëné* "sunlight"
*es* "berries" > *ehé* "berry wine"
*kil* "to step forward" > *kilé* "unit of measurement"
*mays* "barley" > *mayhé* "beer"

*abat* "snake" > *abthé* "mistrust" (poetic)
*kas* "(traditional) law" > *kahé* "order, balance"
*mis* "beauty" > *mihé* "beautiful thing"
### Purpositives

#### -(i)k \[str]

*a* "to go" > *ak* "means of movement"
*ime* "to cook" > *imek* "cooked food"
*khava* "to drink" > *khavak* "drink"
*kort* "lord" > *korttik* "dominion, realm"
*tel* "to give" > *telik* "gift"
*yarm* "to kill" > *yarmbik* "murder victim"
#### -(m)un \[low] (i-class)

*ime* "to cook" > *immun* "cooking ingredient"

### Similatives
#### -ova \[str]
#### -(t)okh \[neut]

### Resultatives - Verbal Abstracts 

#### -(i)n \[len]
The suffix *-(i)n* denotes a non-perfective durative resultative abstract or rather "in the state of being X" 

*aban* "father" > *abnin* "to be a father"
*erbe* "friend" > *erbén* "to be trusted"
*ké* "to break" > *kén* "to be broken"
*muni* "mother" > *munín* "to be a mother"
*së* "one" > *sén* "to be alone"
#### -(i)ns \[len] (s-class) 

*khota* "to see" > *khotans* "sight"
#### -(e)s \[len] (s-class)

*khota* "to see" > *khotás* "visibility"
#### -s (s-class)

*kim* "to pile up" > *kims* "bulk"
### Verbalisers

#### \[low] 
If a noun is vowel-final, its final vowel will be lowered. The exception to this are words with final /a/, which cannot be lowered, thus taking the appearance of zero-derivation. 
#### -V \[neut] 
The verbaliser *-V* takes one of three possible vowels according to the last vowel of the stem. This fact does not change even if the last vowel is elided through syncope. *-a* after /a/, *-e* after /e, i/ and *-o* after /u, o/

*vuled* "hunter" > *vulde* "to hunt"
#### -kV \[neut]
The suffix *-kV* acts similar to *-V* in terms of choice of vowels. It is called an "intensifier" and generally deverbal. Generally in this case means that it only takes verbal bases, including those previously verbalised, even if the base verb itself does not exist. 
The term "intensifier" covers a wide field. In general it means a more "specific" action than the generic verb it is based on. 

*kem* "to scratch" > *kemke* "to write"
*kim* "to pile up" > *kimke* "to collect"
*kurm* "to catch" > *kurmko* "to kidnap"
*poy* "to build, to set in place" > *poyko* "to demarcate"
*yuyu* "to stick together, to much together" > *yuyko* "to be vassals"
# Nominal Morphology
The morphology of nouns as a whole can contain several compounded stems, several derivative suffixes, case suffixes which can be place before or after possessive suffixes, as well as the aforementioned possessive suffixes or demonstrative suffixes in their place.

**compound stem(s) – root – derivative suffix(es) – class/number – case – possessive/demonstrative -case**

## Number/Class Morphology
Kathurn has several noun classes. They are differentiated into human, non-human animate and inanimate. The classes are most visible in the formation of plurals, each class has its own plural form.

|                 | Vowel Final |        | Consonant Final      |        |
| --------------- | ----------- | ------ | -------------------- | ------ |

| m-class         | -m          |        | -em                  |        |
| i-class         | -i          | \[str] | -i                   | \[str] |
| s-class\*       | -s          |        | -s                   |        |
| Lenition        | -0          | \[len] | -0                   | \[len] |
\*All s-class nouns are treated as pluralic and have no singular.

## Possession Morphology

|                 | Singular          | Plural          |
| --------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| 1.masc          | -iyen             | -(y)ene<br>-iyé |

| Inanimate       | -l(e), -Ce, -e    |                 |
## Case Morphology
The case system of Kathurn and Central Yarlish in general consists of eight to ten cases. These cases have different syntactic functions. Morphologically the biggest difference is between the cases which suffix after or before the possessive suffixes. The first group of cases, namely genitive, dative, essive and ablative are suffixed before any other inflectional suffix, while the rest is suffixed last. The other issue is the marking of direct objects. Proto-Yarlish did not have an accusative case, neither do some Lowland Yarlish varieties strictly speaking. The means of accusative marking in Kathurn are rather complex. The cases which precede possessive suffixes are older and likely predate the affixation of possessive markers. Additionally there was the so called **Connective case**, which has been lost in most of Lowland Yarlish and only retained in Kuperian.

The other cases are inventions that happened separately in the successive Yarlish languages. They are therefore also different between different Yarlish languages.
