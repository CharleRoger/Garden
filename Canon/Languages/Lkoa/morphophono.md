morphophono
-----------
when a morpheme ends in a consonant, and the next morpheme begins with a
consonant, one of three things happens:
   the ending consonant of the previous morpheme is vocalized:
     v  > ŭ
     r₁ > a₁
     r₂ > a₂
   the beginning consonant of the next morpheme is elided:
     vV  > V
     r₁V > V
     r₂V > V
   an epenthetic vowel is added to the end of the previous morpheme:
     m n ŋ k q > mŭ ŋŭ ŋŭ qŭ qŭ (note n k > ŋ q)
     d l ł ŧ   > dŏ lŏ łŏ ŧŏ
     C         > Cə₂ ~ Cə₁ (all other consonants)
this happens across word boundaries just as well as within words.

verb phrases
------------
they go:
    P1 P2 P5b P6b VERB-SUFFIX P3 P4 P5a P6a P7 NOUN_PHRASES

P1-P7 are classes of particles:
  P1: some modal, interjectiony particles, most expletives
  P2: a few conjunctiony particles (e.g. m 'CONN1', joa₂ 'if')
  P5b: repetitions of P5a particles (e.g. ŭ 'only')
  P6b: repetitions of P6a particles (e.g. r₁r₂ĭ 'should')
  P3: most true adverbs (e.g. tyiə₁ 'very_much')
  P4: a few voice and modal particles (e.g. r₁r₂ea₂ 'CONN3')
  P5a: tense and negation particles (e.g. ĭ 'FUT', lma₁ 'NEG.FUT', pa₁ 'now',
    ŭ 'only')
  P6a: most aspect and modal particles (e.g. r₁r₂ĭ 'should', lŧa₂ 'still',
    uə₁ 'probably', ŧa₃ 'INCH')
  P7: some modal particles, most voice particles (e.g. vyŏi 'CONN4')

VERB-SUFFIX may be replaced by an adjective or a noun phrase, in which case the
sentence becomes copular. the special case of "\[noun] is \[adjective]" can also
be conveyed with the verb being `exist`, and the adjective being part of the
noun phrase. this is most often used with adjectives that take CONN2
complements (see §connected noun phrases).

some verb phrases take complements that come after them, and are introduced by
connective particles. the most common form of this is being followed by CONN2
and a gerund, but any entry in §connected verb phrases is a valid construction
for this.

noun phrases
------------
they go:
    P5b P6b ADJECTIVE P3 P4 P5a P6a NOUN-POSTBASES
there's no such thing as substantives or adjective nominalization. not all
P3-P6 particles can be used in noun phrases; voice particles and some aspect
particles are forbidden. when a particle is used here, the construction is
equivalent to a relative clause meaning "\[noun] is \[adjective]" to which that
particle is applied.

noun postbases can be:
  deictic
    -va₁ 'other'
    -ea₂ 'a particular
  quantifying
    -ŭ 'every'
    -r₂ə₂ 'any'
  descriptive
    -r₂qłei 'disliked'
    -r₁ŋya₁ 'sandy'
they can also be derivational; there are only five roots for colors:
  vo- 'black'
  ŧsi- 'blue'
  pe- 'yellow'
  łnm- 'bluish grey'
  r₂kl- 'white'
but by adding -va₁ 'other' to all but r₂kl- 'white', four more common color
terms are formed:
  vo-va₁ 'brown'
  ŧsi-va₁ 'navy blue'
  pe-va₁ 'dark yellow'
  łnm-a₁ 'yellowish grey'
this is similar to the english construction "off-white" for slightly colored
white.

pronouns
--------
pronouns are just certain noun phrases with bound referents. usually the noun
will be tŏi 'fox', with some post-base. common pronouns are:

tŏi 'fox', tŏi-va₁ 'fox-other'
used when only two referents need distinguishing: 1-2, 1-3, 2-3, or 3a-3b.
often also 2-1, but only in specific contexts, in which the focus of the
conversation is on the one being spoken to (e.g. when discussing their duties
or activities).

tŏi-młŏa₂ 'fox-stranger'
used as a less familiar, more respective 2nd person pronoun, or as a 3rd person
pronoun when tŏi and tŏi-va₁ are already bound to 1-2, and the one referred to
by tŏi-młŏa₂ isn't present or particularly familiar.

tŏi-r₁qa₂ 'fox-sibling'
used to address siblings, or in adulthood, loved ones of one's own age.

role hierarchy of noun phrases
------------------------------
nouns and adjectives have possible sentence roles associated with them. giving
a noun an adjective overrides its sentence role(s), and this is the standard
way of assigning a non-default role to a noun phrase. (the other way is to use
a voice particle, which are less flexible, and care about the order of the noun
phrases in the sentence.) the possible role assignments, and their symbols in
the lexicon, are:
  E  event
  A  agent
  P  animate patient
  p  inanimate patient
  I  instrument
  L  location
  O  location of origin
  T  location of termination
  t  time
  S  state
  R  reason
  M  mode, quality, constraint
most verbs implicitly take a location, time, reason, and mode. the other roles
are only available on certain verbs, with most verbs additionally taking one of
an event, agent, or patient.

connected noun phrases
----------------------
NP1 m 'CONN2' NP2
used for a variety of things:
- possession of NP1 by NP2
- relative clause, where NP1 is the agent and NP2 is a gerund
- NP1 being a gerund and NP2 being some participant (its nature determined by
  the role hierarchy of noun phrases)
- certain adjectives take complements this way:
  - "a more \[adjective] \[noun] than \[complement]" (with a CMPV adjective)
  - "a \[noun] important to \[complement]"
  - "a \[noun] sad that \[complement with gerund]"

ja₁=m 'set_of' NP1 NP2 \[NP3 ...]
used for describing or delimiting the ranges of things; "this applies to both X
and Y", "this only applies in the case of X, Y, or Z", etc.

connected verb phrases
----------------------
VP1 \[VP2 including ə₁ 'CONN1']
this emphasizes the relationship between VP1 and VP2 without describing it.
"VP1, and then VP2", "VP1, while VP2", "VP1, so VP2", "VP1, therefore VP2", are
all possible interpretations depending on the context.

\[VP1 including joa₂ 'if'] \[VP2 including ə₁ 'CONN1']
"if VP1, then VP2."

VP1 \[VP2 including r₁r₂ea₂ 'CONN3']
this marks a contrastive relationship between VP1 and VP2. it is usually
reasonable to translate this as "VP1, but VP2", or sometimes "VP1, given that
VP2" (when VP2 is less expected than VP1).
## numerals
all commonly-used number words:
yĭ 'one'
r₁a₁ 'two'
r₁a₁-va₁ 'four' (lit. 'other two')
r₁a₁-va₁-va₁ 'eight'
yĭ-va₁ 'negative one'

using these to count from 1 to 16:
yĭ
r₁a₁
r₁a₁ yĭ
r₁a₁va₁
r₁a₁va₁ yĭ
r₁a₁va₁ (yĭ) r₁a₁
r₁a₁va₁va₁ yĭva₁
r₁a₁va₁va₁
r₁a₁va₁va₁ yĭ
r₁a₁va₁va₁ (yĭ) r₁a₁
r₁a₁va₁va₁ (yĭ) r₁a₁ yĭ
r₁a₁va₁va₁ (yĭ) r₁a₁va₁
r₁a₁va₁va₁ (yĭ) r₁a₁va₁ yĭ
r₁a₁va₁va₁ (yĭ) r₁a₁va₁ (yĭ) r₁a₁
