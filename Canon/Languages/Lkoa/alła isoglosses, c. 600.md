(i'm doing these in advance, because i have the time and motivation today, and we might not next round.)
all of these are west-east isoglosses, except for the last one, which is cismontane-transmontane (with cismontane being the side of the mountains facing the shore). transmontane alła is on the east side of most isoglosses.

r-w shift
west:
aɑ > ɰa (metathesis)
ɰ > w (rounding)
ə > w /V\_ (rounding)
ŋ > ʁ /_{q, a†, ɑ, u} (fortition)

†This change avoided original /æ/, which was mostly merged into /a/ but still preserved sparsely. As a result, also, a few roots with original /a/ were irregularly hypercorrected back to /ŋa/ in regions didn't make the distinction.

east:
r < ʁ < ɰ /\_C (chain shift fortition)
ɰ > x /_V (devoicing; was already realized as [ɣ] in this environment)
ç > x (backing, merger with ɰ)

eastern vowel shift
universal:
æ > a

(this change was already given for r₂lła₂ > alła; this is just finishing the job.)

west:
ø > ə

east and transmontane:
a > i /#_{s, ɬ, ð̞, l} (raising)
a > e /#_{t, t͡s, t͡ɬ} (raising)

east, but not transmontane:
ø, y > o, u /_{ŋ, k, q, ɰ, ʁ} (backing)
ø, y > e, i / everywhere else (unrounding)
{ɤ, ɯ} > ɨ (fronting)

cluster simplification
west:
N > ∅ /C_ where C is not a nasal, but not root-finally (elision)
root-final N becomes syllabic
{s, ɬ}V > V{s, ɬ} /_# (metathesis)
remaining CC and CCC roots (not ending in N) get an epenthetic vowel:
  ∅ > ɯ /{k, q}\_#
  ∅ > ɤ /{ð̞, l, ɬ, t͡ɬ}\_#
  ∅ > ɑ / otherwise

east:
CN > NC /#_ where C is not a nasal (metathesis)
sV > V \[-voice] /\_# (elision, devoicing)

far east (cismontane only):
ɬV > V \[-voice] /\_# (elision, devoicing)

fricative mergers
cismontane: no changes

transmontane:
ʃ < s < ð̞ (backing, chain shift fortition)†
s < ɬ /\_{n, t, t͡s} (assibilation)
ɬ < ç (chain shift fronting and lateralization)
l > ɬ /\_{t, t͡s, ɬ} (devoicing)

†the new /s/ is dental \[s̪].
## an example text:

"you will live where there are lemmings. if you do not catch a lemming one season, you will move somewhere else, and catch a lemming in the next season."

**sound change minutia: alła VŭV** 
intervocalic _ŭ_ /ɯ/ got reinterpreted as a consonant glide between 300–600. but the eastern vowel shift happened first, which unconditionally turned /ɯ/ into /ɨ/. so in the east, it turned into /j/, while in the west and transmontane regions, it became /ɰ/. the latter regions then had sound changes eliminating /ɰ/ entirely, turning it into /w/ and /x/ respectively, in that environment. so the three lects ended up with different reflexes of intervocalic _ŭ_ (< r₂lła₂ _v_ /ʋ/ after a morpheme boundary):
```
STAGE  0   I   II  III
           evs gli ɰ--
----------------------
west:  ɯ   ɯ   ɰ   w
east:  ɯ   ɨ   j   j
tmon:  ɯ   ɯ   ɰ   x
```
this is reflected in the above example, where their reflex of alła _caŭa_ (< r₂lła₂ _ta₁-va₁_ `place-other`) is _cawa_, _caja_, and _caxa_ respectively.
