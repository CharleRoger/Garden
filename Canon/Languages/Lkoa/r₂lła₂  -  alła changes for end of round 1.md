phono:
— regional mergers of a₁ and a₂ (/æ a/) to /a/ \[æ̠ ~ ɐ]; for simplicity's sake, this will be the lect that we develop in the future, but anyway the distinction doesn't go away everywhere. the merged phoneme is spelled \<a>.
— a₃ and most of ə₁ (/ɒ ə/) merge to /ɑ/ <ɑ>; ə₁ is retained in diphthongs and (C)V syllables, as well as a couple random CCV syllables
— environments in which r₁ r₂ v /ɣ ʁ ʋ/ are vocalized to a₁ a₂ ŭ /æ a ɯ/, previously restricted to C_#C environments (in which # is a morpheme or word boundary), now also include the edges of words (but not postbases), and any C_C environment whatsoever. notably, this, along with the first change, makes the language's new name alła /alɬa/.
— some of the most frequent and semantically bleached adjectives and "pronouns" experience some irregular lenitions and simplifications:
  — tŏi /tɤi/ 'fox' (the most common pronoun) becomes cr₁i /t͡sɣi/ \[t͡sɰi]
  — tŏiva₁ /tɤivæ/ 'other fox' (the other most common pronoun) becomes cr₁a /t͡sɣa/ \[t͡sɰa] (expected reflex is tŏiva)
  — qn /qn/ 'end, destination' becomes qŋ /qŋ/ \[qɴ]
  — jluə₁ /jluə/ 'this (time)' becomes juə₁ /juə/
  — tr₁ /tɣ/ 'place, time, state' becomes ca /t͡sa/ (expected reflex is ta)
  — no /no/ 'only one' becomes ŋo /ŋo/
  — qŭ /qɯ/ 'more' becomes qa /qa/
  — ŋŋ /ŋː/ 'reason' becomes ŋ /ŋ/ (homophonous with ŋ 'lemming')
  — lqquə₁ /lqːuə/ 'perpendicular to wind' becoms quə₁ /quə/

grammar:
— adjectives open up as a class slightly. newly-coined adjectives can't have the event, terminus, or reason roles (but this isn't the last we'll see of them).
— analogy has started leveling some of the location-based adjectives into a more regular tsez-like paradigm, where different forms of locative roles are differentiated (space, surface, point, etc.) with more-or-less regular postbases.

vocabulary:
— some yalma loans for foods
— some haankaysiw loans for tech 

more phono (prosody in particular): while initially having just initial stress, the r/v-vocalization change created some initial vowels, which encouraged stress to shift down-word (by analogy with words like _alła_ suddenly having final instead of initial stress). it equalized at stress on the third syllable of the word, or final stress on two-syllable words. the consequent lenition of unstressed syllables is partly what drove the reduction of _tŏiva₁_ all the way to _cr₁a_. this will become a more prominent feature in later rounds, and eventually result in the death of the postbase system.
