#language/atteric #kóty 

The **Proto-Atteric** or **Proto-Attere language** is the reconstructed common ancestor of the [[Atteric languages]]. It is thought to have originally been spoken on the shores of the [[Bay of Lokkat]].

From the common vocabulary which has been reconstructed on the basis of present-day [[Atteric languages]] it appears that agriculture, fishing and the use of boats were already known to the early [[Atteric peoples]] before their expansion began, but iron-working was still unknown. This places the date of the start of the expansion somewhere in the [[8th century BGS]].

## Pronouns

Pronouns in Proto-Atteric, as in daughter languages, are clitics, meaning that they appear only affixed to verbs or nouns and do not stand alone.
