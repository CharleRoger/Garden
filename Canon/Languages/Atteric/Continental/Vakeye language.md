# History
Around 650 BGS, many [[Atteric peoples|Atteric people]] migrated towards the [[Khey desert]], motivated by mass migration happening in [[Kóty]] due to climate and found solace in the endless grasslands of the soon to change [[Khey desert]], said to be the previous home of [[Para-Ardanic people]] and much earlier [[Katic culture]].

Around 400 BGS they settled around the fertile [[Kóty bottleneck|bottleneck region of Kóty]] that grants access to the desert. A [[Vakeye kingdom]] was established around 467 BGS with the first king [[Dedo-Mayale]] ascending to the throne and ruling through the first years of the dry desert.

Around 0 BGS [[Vakeye people]] migrated further inland into the desert, as a window of rains made the desert fertile again, thus they established around the [[Rabak]]-speaking [[Rharnic peoples]]. Both cultures integrated and syncretized many gods and traditions as the [[Rharnic peoples]] were further integrated into the [[Vakeye people]], adopting their language and worldviews.
