## History
Around the 650BGS, many atteric people migrated towards the [[Khey desert]], motivated by mass migration happening in [[Koty]] due to climate, they found solace in the endless grasslands of the soon to change Khey desert, said to be the previous home of [[Para-Ardanic people]] and much previously [[Katic culture]].

Around 400BGS they stablished around the [[Bottleneck region]] of Koty that grants access to the desert and its plenty fertile. A Vakeye kingdom was stablished around 467BGS with the first king Dedo-Mayale(?) ascended to the throne and ruled through the first years of the dry desert.

Around 0BGS Vakeye people migrated further inland into the desert, as a window of rains made the desert fertile again, thus they established around the [[Rabak people]]. 
Both cultures integrated and syncretized lots of gods and traditions, around the same both Rabak and Rotak people were further integrated by Vakeye people, adopting their language and worldviews, they all persevered in the desert till nowadays.
