**Proto-Attere** is the reconstructed common ancestor of the [[Attere languages]]. It is thought to have originally been spoken in [[Bay of Lokkat]] in the continent shores.

Like other proto-languages, there is no record of Proto-Attere. From the common vocabulary which has been reconstructed on the basis of present-day [[Attere languages]] it appears that agriculture, fishing and the use of boats were already known to the Attere people before their expansion before their expansion began, but iron-working was still unknown. This places the date of the start of the expansion somewhere between [[8th century]] 700BGS.
