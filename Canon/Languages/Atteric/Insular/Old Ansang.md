**Old Ansang** also called **Classic Ansang** is was the earliest recorded variety of the [[Ansang]] spoken roughly throughout the [[6th century]] into the following centuries. Spoken by the [[Ansang people]] it's the ancestral language of both [[Yuge language]] and many of the modern dialects of Ansang, among them the most spoken [[Ansang Islands]].
It's an agglutinative language and polysynthetic, most of it's grammatical constructions and morpheme can be agglutinated forming long words that encompass several phrases.
## History

Originally spoken by [[Ansang people]], that live in the [[Ansang islands]] an archipelago of eight islands considered to be the womb of the world according to [[Ansaŋetuʼakɨmi]] the common belief system of Ansang people.

It belongs to the [[Atteric languages]] family, a group of languages spoken in Kóty alongside with [[Dreic languages]], [[Hautaric languages]], [[Koyanic languages]] and [[Cisi language]].

The first writings of the Ansang language are from when the [[Lavondu]] first arrived in the Ansang islands in the 7th century.

## Phonology
### Consonants
Later Ansang features a consonantal inventory characterized by its pre-nasal consonants, and peculiar implosive consonants that are direct influence of loan words from [[Möxali]].

### Phonotactics
Ansang syllable structure is observed to be simple plain (C)V(V)(C).
### Morphonology
Phonological processes in Old Ansang observed throughout the entire language, depending on the adjacent morphemes or their position in a word.
## Grammar
Ansang is mostly SVO, with nominative-accusative alignment.
### Particles
Ansang language features three particles, they are used to mark nouns according to their grammatical case or thematic relation in a sentence or clause.
- *ŋgo* marks the comitative, instrumental of an object. Comparable to a genitive/dative.
- *ndel* marks the generic locative position of a noun. Comparable to the locative.
- *masa* marks the goal of any movement. This goal may be the end location or a state of affairs, i.e., a purpose. Comparable to the allative case.

> *Suta tɨrincuŋgɨ **masa** simbil ñimocaŋɨ musu isimi*
> `Suta tɨr=incu-ŋgɨ masa simbil ñ=imoc-aŋɨ musu isimi` 
> `NAME 3SG=swim-PST towards axe 3INA=sink-PST`
> "Suta swam towards the hatchet that sank in the depths of the lake."

### Nouns
#### Pronouns
Pronouns are clitics that must be attached to the lexical element comes suffixing or prefixing the root word. They themselves don't have an isolated form to which they can function on their own.

|             |     | -   | Subject  | Object   | Possessive | Locative | Resultative |
| ----------- | --- | --- | -------- | -------- | ---------- | -------- | ----------- |
| 1st         | Sg. | -   | *mbu-*   | *-lai*   | *-re-*     | *rut-*   | *ko-*       |
| ^           | Pl. | -   | *nda’-*  | *-lɨ’*   | *-may-*    | *hur-*   | ^           |
| 2nd         | Sg. | -   | *vel-*   | *-nde*   | *-tu-*     | *ŋgu-*   | *o-*        |
| Animate/3rd | ^   | -   | *tɨr-*   | *-mbai’* | *-yu-*     | *ruk-*   | ^           |
| 2nd/3rd     | Pl. | -   | *ŋges-*  | *-lu*    | *-hey-*    | *tov-*   | ^           |
| Inanimate   | <   | -   | -*ñ(i)-* | <        | *ŋe-*      | <        | <           |
- **Subject pronouns**: Subject of the intransitive/transitive verb, essentially the Nominative.
- **Object pronouns**: Object of the transitive verb, essentially the Accusative.
- **Possessive pronouns**: Possessor prefixes, in verbs assumes function of reflexive pronoun going after the subject pronouns rendering them infixes.
- **Locative pronouns**: Locative deixis for pronouns, only **animate objects** may be marked with the locative, otherwise the particle *ndel* maybe used. In verbs assumes function of Andative and Venitive verbal deixis.
- Resultative pronouns:  Indicates state of change of a person.

> *kouŋoto orot*
> `ko-uŋoto orot`
> `1.RES=drink water`
> "I'll become the one drinking the water."

> *opoñeʼendi ndel vombɨt usonjo*
> `o=   poñe  -ʼendi ndel vombɨt usonjo.`
> `2.RES=health-IRR   LOC next day`
> "May you become healthy by the next day."

#### Derivation
Derivation in Ansang is a common act, and it is used in normal speech, mainly to form neologism the language does not has a root for it, or to simply to standardize the morphology.

| Meaning        | -   | Morpheme |
| -------------- | --- | -------- |
| Place          | -   | -po      |
| Human          | -   | -yeʼe    |
| Adjectivizer   | -   | -her     |
| Profession     | -   | -mo      |
| Language       | -   | -nji     |
| Maker          | -   | -xa      |
| Nominalizer    | -   | -oñ      |
| Noun into verb | -   | -si      |
### Demonstatives

|                         | -   |        |
| ----------------------- | --- | ------ |
| Proximal                | -   | se     |
| Medial                  | -   | unju   |
| Distal                  | -   | yasa   |
| Non-visible but audible | -   | ye’eyu |
| Non-audible but visible | -   | ’e’e   |
### Reduplication

Reduplication is a core feature of Old Ansang, it is highly productive in morphological process both present in verbs, nouns and adjectives. 
#### Reduplication in nouns
In **nouns**, reduplication assumes much broader and less constrained rules, allowing speakers to coin a myriad of new meanings, such as *mbo∼mboŋ* "big rock" or more commonly translated as "made of rocks".
* *enu* 'sadness' > *enunu* 'depression'.
* *hɨra* 'fire' > *hɨrara* 'big fire, forest fire'.
* *hekeʼe* 'sky' > *hekeʼeke* 'firmament'.
* *poʼo* 'endless' > *poʼopo* 'infinity, forever and ever'.
* *vɨŋɨ* 'milk' > *vɨŋɨŋɨ* 'fermented milk, yogurt'.
* *canja* 'happiness' > *canjanja* 'be euphoric; motivation'.
* *emaʼ* 'cloud' > *emammaʼ* 'tempest, storm'.

Commonly done in name conventions, one of the most common names is _mbomboŋ_ "made out of rocks/strong as rocks"
### Verbs
#### Transitive verbs

Transitive verbs in Ansang language are the ones that take the most morphology of all.

| -2                     | -1                                 | 0        | 1          | <         | <        | 2            | 3           | 4                                 |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------- | ---------- | --------- | -------- | ------------ | ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Optional Prefix**    | **Subject of the transitive verb** | **Stem** | **TAM**    | <         | <        | **Negation** | **Converb** | **Object of the transitive verb** |
| **Directional prefix** | ^                                  | **Root** | **Aspect** | **Tense** | **Mood** | ^            | ^           | ^                                 |
#### TAM

Verbs in Ansang are not conjugated by person, they exhibit a system of TAM (Tense Aspect and Mood) with, Past and Non-Past Tense,  Imperative and Infinitive. They change accordingly to the last phoneme of the verb root.

Their etymology vary a lot, but it is theorized they are innovations or simply metathesis of the same suffix.

Although the use of these varies on the last phoneme of the root of the word, the row V# is the most used among all other ones, marked with green as the most prominent.

|     | -   | Infinitive | Negative | Non-Past | Past   | Irrealis | Passive |
| --- | --- | ---------- | -------- | -------- | ------ | -------- | ------- |
| C#  | -   | _-anje_    | _-ye_    | _-eye_   | _-aŋɨ_ | _-andi_  | _-e_    |
| V#  | -   | _-nja_     | _-le_    | _-re_    | _-ŋgɨ_ | _-ʼendi_ | _-ʼelo_ |
| Vy# | -   | _-ay_      | _-el_    | _-ela_   | _-ɨŋ_  | _-ande_  | _-ol_   |
#### Infinitive

Special form of verbs that can be used as a noun, adjective, or adverb, in Old Ansang is no different to what English speakers are used to.

#### Non Past

Sometimes also called the Terminal conjugation of a verb, it's the base zero of a verb root.

#### Irrealis

A free label of a sequence of various moods, including the future tense sometimes.

#### Passive

The grammatical subject expresses the theme or patient of the main verb that is, the person or thing that undergoes the action or has its state changed.

Bellow we can see a example of a sentence with use of Negative particle:
> *mbundixiŋgɨlelu*
> `mbu-ndixi-ŋgɨ-le-lu`
> `1=kiss-PST-NEG`
> 'I didn’t kiss you'

> `rut-xap ndekot-eye-nde`
> `1SG.LOC-temple pray-NPST-2.SG.ACC`
> 'I am at the temple praying to you'

> `mbu-ayondɨ-ŋgɨ-le-mbai’ uriŋ`
> `1SG.NOM-eat-NEG-PST-3SG.ACC meat`
> 'I didn't eat meat'
#### Causatives
**Causatives** in Old Ansang come from the word _voŋɨ_ "to give", it's also used as a benefactive and dative preposition.

> `mbu=karar-eye voŋɨ=nde`
> `1SG.NOM=work-NPST give-2SG.ACC`
> "I'll do the work for you"

## Syntax

Ansang is mostly SVO, with nominative-accusative alignment.

### Basic transitive construction

Ansang language exhibits a SVO word order.

### Basic intransitive construction

### Ditransitives

### Relative clauses

Demonstratives are used in relative clauses _se_ "this" became a common relativizer. 

> *mbaimbai mbuoti’ŋgɨmbai’ se orɨt tɨronjalayɨ*
> `mbaimbai mbu=oti’-ŋgɨ=mbai’ se orɨt tɨr=onjal-ayɨ`
> `man 1SG=see-PST=3SG REL yesterday 3SG=leave-PST`
> "The man I saw yesterday has left."

_se_ is also used as an participle marker coming before the verb which also can be described as adverb.

> *mbusil ndel ɨrsɨr se velotiʼayɨmbaiʼ orɨt*
> `mbu=sil ndel ɨrsɨr se vel=otiʼ-ayɨ=mbaiʼ orɨt`
> `1SG=live LOC house REL 2SG=see-PST=3SG yesterday`
> "I live in the house that you saw yesterday."

### Converb
Formed from the productive word _ɨtɨ_ "thing" being grammaticalized as nominalizer.

> *velmborot ndayɨtɨ, ndaʼahako ndorokka*
> `vel=mborot ndayɨtɨ, ndaʼ-ahako ndorok-ka`
> `2=sew TERM.CVB 1=sing song-PL`
> "While you are sewing, we sing songs"
#### Rukɨtɨ

For an imperfective, conditional and locative converb (most known converb conjugation):

> *mbaimbai xaplu tɨrɨmbo rukɨtɨ tɨrotiʼ ɨp njire*
> `mbaimbai xap-lu tɨr-ɨmbo rukɨtɨ tɨr-otiʼ ɨp njire`
> `man temple-3.ACC 3.NOM-go CVB 3.NOM-see ART bird`
> "The man, while going to the temple, saw a bird"
#### Voŋɨtɨ
Grammaticalized from the verb 'to give' *voŋɨ*, it's a purposive and causal converb:

> *mbutoret se toʼor kake voŋɨtɨ*
> `mbu=toret se toʼor kake voŋɨtɨ`
> `1=scale DEM fish cook CVB`
> "I scale this fish in order to cook it"

> *velayondɨʼendi uŋoto voŋɨtɨ* 
> `vel=ayondɨ-ʼendi uŋoto voŋɨtɨ`
> `2=eat-IRR drink CVB`
> "You must eat, in order to drink."
#### Ndayɨtɨ

From the verb 'to leave' *nday*, here it is grammaticalized given a terminative converb:

> *mbulonjor ndayɨtɨ mbureseyele tutere*
> `mbu-lonjor ndayɨtɨ mbu-res-eye-le tu-tere`
> `1.NOM-die TERM.CVB 1.NOM-forget-NPST.NEG 2.GEN-kindness`
> "Until I die, I'll not forget your kindness"

### Complementizer: *alerukɨt* and *alendayɨ*

From the two words _Ale_ "to say" and _Rukɨtɨ_ Converb (analyzed as the most common converb derived from the imperfective converb), the word it is grammaticalized as a complementizer. Another word rarely seen but also used in literature is *Alendayɨ*, from _Ale_ "to say" and _Ndayɨtɨ_ "terminative converb".

> *Tata tɨrumanjire alerukɨt tɨrɨrot*
> `tata tɨr=umanji-re alerukɨt tɨr-ɨrot`
> `father 3=come-NPST CVB 3-know`
> "He knows that father will come tomorrow"

### Conjunction

#### _yo/ŋal_ - coordination for nominals and adjectives

_Yo_ is the main coordination of Ansang translated as "and-NP", The numbers or nouns or noun phrases that can be conjoined to _yo_ is unlimited unlike _ŋal_ which is solely for adjectives and adjectival phrases. Verbs take the converbs show above.


### Questions (polar, content)

Question intonation is often used as a way to convey questions, be it polar or content.
As such, Old Ansang is not devoid of content interrogative words.

|                         | -   | Question word |
| ----------------------- | --- | ------------- |
| Manner (How)            | -   | *kimbi*       |
| Direction (In what way) | -   | *vumbaiʼo*    |
| Time (When)             | -   | *kɨcyu*       |
| Quantity (How many)     | -   | *ŋgɨt*        |
| Person (Who)            | -   | *tuvi*        |
| Thing (What)            | -   | *kava*        |
| Space (Where)           | -   | *kɨʼos*       |
| Reason (Why)            | -   | *mbeimbei*    |

### Directional (orientational) prefixes
Some verbs may not take directional prefixes, those that do, are verbs related to movement. Like to go, to pass, to flow and to arrive.

- _ŋay-_ Upward
- _ot-_ Up stream/Inward
- _la-_ Neutral
- _ŋge-_ Downward
- _ɨr-_ Down stream/Outward
- _map-_ Towards the speaker

## Writing system

Around the year 900 AGS, the [[Lavondu]] people sailed to the Ansang islands, some years later in 950 AGS their writing system the [[Opsíbdañox]] developed into [[Ansang Writing System]].

## Lavondu contact and borrowings

As Lavondu people arrived in Ansang islands, they stablished around and their native language changed and with ansang and möxali language being in a contact words were loaned.

- **yovɨdʼonlon** "book, manuscript"
- **soxbʼo** "paper"
- **bʼones** "brushpaint"
- **bʼovo** "omen"

And many other words...

## Oral tradition
## Literature

Ansang literature is characterized by highly religious texts that can be traced back by its origins when the [[Lavondu]] first came into contact with Ansang, in the [[9th century]].

The first paragraph of the historical essay of a famous writer, [[ʼIʼici]].

> *Ilapaka tɨpima akatupɨne axekeŋgɨ ndel ameʼ*
> `ilap-aka tɨpima akatupɨne axek-e-ŋgɨ ndel ameʼ`
> `ship-PL new shape come-PASS-PST LOC ocean`
> "Ships of a new kind came from the ocean"

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Later Ansang (500-900AGS)|Ansang ??? (900-1200AGS)|Translation|
|_Ilapaka tɨpima akatupɨne axekeŋgɨ ndel ameʼ._||Ships of a new kind came from the ocean, there people exited the ships, they have body paint and spoke a different tongue like the many people of Kóty, they speak of complicated affairs as they arrive in our boundaries. They've brought culture, language, science and writing to us, we've brought culture, language, science and religion to them, both of valuable meaning and thus celebrated by both parties in the year of [insert smth here].|
