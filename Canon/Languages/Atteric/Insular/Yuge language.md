## Morphology

### Syllable structure

Yuge language is a completely CV (consonant-vowel) or V (vowel), lacking any kind of consonant clusters like Ansang does.

### Reduplication

Reduplication of noun and verbs in Yugebusorese is as important as it is in Ansang, featuring similar functions, but some are innovative and fossilized from Common-Ansangic, reduplication of first syllable of nouns to form the meaning _"made out of X/ I'm (strong/healthy) like X",_ for example:

- _mogo_ (rock, stone)
	- _momogo_ (Made out of stone/  strong like stone)

- _ukuno_ (flower)
	- _ukukuno_ (Made out of flowers/ (delicate/beautiful) like flowers.
