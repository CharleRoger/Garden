**Proto-Gäj** (abbreviated **PGäj**) is the reconstructed ancestor of the "Gäj" branch of the Koyanic languages.

## Vowels
|           |     | Front      | Back       |
| --------- | --- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Close     | -   | \*i \*ī    | \*u \*ū    |
| Close-mid | -   | \*e \*ē    | \*o \*ō    |
| Open-mid  | -   | (\*ɛ \*ɛ̄) | (\*ɔ \*ɔ̄) |
| Open      | -   | \*æ \*ǣ   | \*a \*ā    |
Long vowels and the open front vowel \*æ were only present in stressed syllables.

The open-mid vowels \*ɛ \*ɛ̄ \*ɔ \*ɔ̄ are a hypothetical addition to the Proto-Gäj phonological system which may help to explain certain reflexes in the earliest diverging Gäj language, [[Zangahan]]. Proto-Gäj is usually considered with these vowels, since their existence is based mostly on [[Proto-Koyanic language|Proto-Koyanic]], having apparently merged with the open vowels \*æ \*ǣ \*a \*ā respectively in all other Gäj languages.

The long close vowels \*ī \*ū are thought to have had centralising diphthong qualities [i̯ɨ u̯ʉ] respectively, at least by some late stage of Proto-Gäj.
