The **Hnäzb languages** or **Hnäzbic languages** are a subfamily of the [[Koyanic languages|Koyanic language family]] which were spoken all over western [[Fountainhead]] by the [[Hnäzb people]]. The Hnäzb languages in particular were found in the [[Red Steppe]] and adjacent areas of [[Qnōp']], as well as the [[Uhustaw]], where the regional variation of the [[Nespe people]] lived.

# Proto-Hnäzb

The [[Proto-Hnäzb language]] is the ancestor of all Hnäzbic languages. It is estimated that it was spoken some time after [[1st millennium BGS|1000 BGS]] and originated from an area known as [[Bezgon]]. The likely speakers of [[Proto-Hnäzb language|Proto-Hnäzb]] belonged to the [[Northern-Koty Pre-Metallic Complex]], an archaeological culture of the [[1st millennium BGS]]. 

# Later varieties

## Common Hnäzb

[[Common Hnäzb]] is a Koiné spoken from the [[3rd century|3rd]] to the [[7th century]] by various [[Hnäzb people|Hnäzb tribes]]. It represents an overlap between several diverging Hnäzb varieties and was fostered by the growing political structures of the [[Qneček]] of this era. Most tribes spoke both [[Common Hnäzb]] and their own dialects, which both existed in a web of interrelations. 

## Nespe

The [[Nespe language]] is a divergent Hnäzbic variety, which developed in the [[Uhustaw]] (Nespe: *[[Uhustaw#Name|Čüüwän]]*) in the north of the Hnäzb-speaking region. Due to environmental and political factors, the Nespe people became linguistically more isolated earlier than other [[Hnäzb people]] (although interactions did persist still). They did not participate in any of the [[Qneček]] and didn't acquire [[Common Hnäzb]].
