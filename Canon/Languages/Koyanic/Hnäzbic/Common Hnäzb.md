Common Hnäzb is a [[Hnäzb languages|Hnäzbic language]] spoken from the [[3rd century]] to the [[7th century]] in the [[Red Steppe]]. Common Hnäzb is a Koiné language, which is an amalgamation of various Hnäzb dialects and languages. It served as common lingua franca among the various tribes. 

# Phonology
## Vowels

|       | Front        | Front.Rounded | Back         | Back.Rounded |
| ----- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Close | i iː <i, ii> | y yː <ü, üü>  | ɯ ɯː <ı, ıı> | u uː <u, uu> |
| Mid   |              | œ œː <ö, öö>  |              | ɔ ɔː <o, oo> |
| Open  | æ æː <ä, ää> |               | a aː <a, aa> |              |
- /ɔ/ vowels tend to vary between \[ɔ] proper and \[o]. 
- /œ/ vowels tend to vary between \[œ] proper and \[ø].
- /a/ vowels are often backed to be more like \[ɑ]. 
- Unstressed short /ɯ/ assumes the form of \[ə]. 
- Unstressed short /i/ assumes the form of \[e]. 
- Stressed long /æː/ can be articulated as \[ɛː] or even \[eː]. 

Before postalveolar consonants, long mid vowels are realised as palatalised diphthongs \[œi̯] and \[ɔi̯].

### Allophonies (Phonetic variation)
The following allophonies are largely variations of individual speakers based on dialectical variants. As other Hnäzb varieties have diverged, speakers bring in their own changes or struggle with some pronunciations. 

- Plain stops and affricates vary freely between being voiced and being unvoiced. This is especially frequent in northern varieties, where intervocalic plain consonants are generally voiced. This is either a local development or a local contact induced change. 
- Some speakers usw \[h] in places corresponding to /ɕ/ due to debuccalisation in some dialects
- The differences between velars and uvulars can be blurred. Particular changes are /x/ > /χ/ or vice versa, /q/ > /k/ conditioned by vowel quality, /qʰ/ > /h/. A special case is the merger of /q/ with /ʁ/ and /ɰ/ into \[ʁ]. 
- /z/ is by some speakers taken as an approximent \[ɹ] or even fully rhoticised into \[r]. This is probably a structural analogy, given that within the parallel system of [[Proto-Hnäzb]] /z/ is within the same natural group as /m, n, j, ɰ/. 
- The reverse analogy is also present within the range of Common Hnäzb, /j/ being fricativized into \[ʒ]. Again this variation may or may not be inherited from Proto-Hnäzb. 
- The original phonetic value of /ʁ/ is unclear. In Common Hnäzb it appears either as secondary effect causing rhotic vowels or as intrusive \[a̯] vowel forming diphthongs. For some speakers it has merged with /q/ to be realised as \[ɢ]. 
- The unvoiced nasals also have a wider range of realisations. /m̥/ in particular can be realised as \[w, f, ʍ] or \[ɔ̯̃] in final position. Its counterpart /n̥/ remains as nasalization if reduced. In onset position both frequently appear as aspirated like their plosive counterparts, resulting in \[mʰ] and \[nʰ]. 
- /ɰ/ is very often labialised into \[w]. Further labilisation that takes place in northwestern dialects, might be the result of contact with [[Nambāno]]. 
# Nominal Morphology
The nominal morphology of Common Hnäzb is in large parts a variation of the morphology of Proto-Hnäzb.
