**Common Hnäzb** is a [[Hnäzb languages|Hnäzbic language]] spoken from the [[3rd century]] to the [[7th century]] in the [[Red Steppe]]. Common Hnäzb is a Koiné language, which is an amalgamation of various Hnäzb dialects and languages. It served as common lingua franca among the various tribes.

| ----- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Close | **i, ii** /i, iː/ | **ü, üü** /y, yː/ | **ı, ıı** /ɯ, ɯː/ | **u, uu** /u, uː/ |
| Mid   |                   | **ö, öö** /œ, œː/ |                   | **o, oo** /ɔ, ɔː/ |
| Open  | **ä, ää** /æ, æː/ |                   | **a, aa** /a, aː/ |                   |
- /ɔ/ vowels tend to vary between \[ɔ] proper and \[o]. 
- /œ/ vowels tend to vary between \[œ] proper and \[ø].
- /a/ vowels are often backed to be more like \[ɑ]. 
- Unstressed short /ɯ/ assumes the form of \[ə]. 
- Unstressed short /i/ assumes the form of \[e]. 
- Stressed long /æː/ can be articulated as \[ɛː] or even \[eː]. 

Before postalveolar consonants, long mid vowels are realised as palatalised diphthongs \[œi̯] and \[ɔi̯].

### Allophony
The following allophonic are largely variations of individual speakers based on dialectical variants. As other Hnäzb varieties have diverged, speakers bring in their own changes or struggle with some pronunciations.
- Plain stops and affricates vary freely between being voiced and being unvoiced. This is especially frequent in northern varieties, where intervocalic plain consonants are generally voiced. This is either a local development or a local contact induced change. 
- Some speakers use \[h] in places corresponding to /ɕ/ due to debuccalisation in some dialects
- The differences between velars and uvulars can be blurred. Particular changes are /x/ > /χ/ or vice versa, /q/ > /k/ conditioned by vowel quality, /qʰ/ > /h/. A special case is the merger of /q/ with /ʁ/ and /ɰ/ into \[ʁ]. 
- /z/ is by some speakers taken as an approximant \[ɹ] or even fully rhotacised into \[r]. This is probably a structural analogy, given that within the parallel system of [[Proto-Hnäzb language|Proto-Hnäzb]] /z/ is within the same natural group as /m, n, l, j, ɰ/. 
- The reverse analogy is also present within the range of Common Hnäzb, /j/ being fricativized into \[ʒ]. Again this variation may or may not be inherited from Proto-Hnäzb. 
- The original phonetic value of /ʁ/ is unclear. In Common Hnäzb it appears either as secondary effect causing rhotic vowels or as intrusive \[a̯] vowel forming diphthongs. For some speakers it has merged with /q/ to be realised as \[ɢ]. 
- The unvoiced nasals also have a wider range of realisations. /m̥/ in particular can be realised as \[w, f, ʍ] or \[ɔ̯̃] in final position. Its counterpart /n̥/ remains as nasalization if reduced. In onset position both frequently appear as aspirated like their plosive counterparts, resulting in \[mʰ] and \[nʰ]. 
- /ɰ/ is very often labialised into \[w]. Further labialisation that takes place in north-western dialects, might be the result of contact with [[Nambāno]]. 
# Nominal Morphology
The nominal morphology of Common Hnäzb is in large parts a variation of the morphology of Proto-Hnäzb. The functions of cases is the same as in Proto-Hnäzb. The differences between the absolutive, accusative and partitive lie within class, plurality and definiteness. 

Absolutive Objects: Inanimate Direct Object
Accusative Objects: Definite Direct Object Animate 
Partitive Objects:  Indefinite Direct Object High-Animate (Pl), Indefinite Direct Object (Low)-Animate. 

The genitive has been replaced by the possessive and appears only in compounds.

| ------------ | ------------ | ------------- | --------- |
| Absolutive   | -(w)a        | -0            | -(aa)qh   |

# Verbal Morphology 

## Stem Types (Redaction needed)

As with [[Proto-Hnäzb language|Proto-Hnäzb]], Common Hnäzb differentiates between two stem forms, which can be called ventive and separative. The general distinction is whether something is in regards to or from the topic or to or from elsewhere. The difference is most visible in verbs of motion, where it translated into "to come" vs "to go away", in other instances it means "beneficial to the subject" vs something else. In yet other cases the differences in meaning have become removed from this original distinction. By convention these are called ventive and separative. 

There are two modes of changing stem types, prefixing and ablauting. 
The prefixing type appears before complex onsets, as well as sonorant (m, n, w, y, z, rh) onsets. It has two prefixes: o- for the ventive type and a- for the separative type. 

The ablauting type differentiates between two grades, labial and non-labial, which in turn equal the o- and a- prefixes. In this system the non-labial form is taken to be the base form, except there the stem vowel used to be /o/ or /u/. 

| Grade      | Non-Labial | Labial |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------ |
| Non-Labial | a          | o      |
|            | ä          | ö      |
|            | i          | ü      |
|            | ı          | ü      |
| Labial     | i          | u      |
|            | a          | o      |

| Ventive<br>(Labial) | <                     | Separative<br>(Non-Labial) | <                          |
