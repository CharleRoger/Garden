Proto-Hnäzb is the hypothetical ancestor of the [[Hnäzb languages|Hnäzbic languages]]. It is a [[Koyanic languages|Koyanic]] language and thus related to [[Nambāno]], [[Qachkav]] and many others. 

It is estimated that Proto-Hnäzb was spoken by the [[Northern-Koty Pre-Metallic Complex]] and by the [[South-Koyanic Pastoralic Complex]]. The former likely spoke an early form of Proto-Hnäzb, still more in line with its ancestral language, while the latter made up the speaker community of the ancestral language of all Hnäzb languages. For this reason the SKP is sometimes called the Proto-Hnäzb culture. 

Around the [[1st century|1st]] and [[2nd century]] Proto-Hnäzb diverged in individual dialects, although these varieties remained relatively similar to each other due to continued contact. The [[3rd century]] saw the complate dominance of Hnäzb over the [[Red Steppe]] and the formation of the [[Common Hnäzb]] language, which served as Koiné of the Hnäzb people until the [[7th century]]. Proto-Hnäzb and Common Hnäzb morphology are largely identical, while the sound system changed due to phonological diffusion. 

# Phonology 

## History (PKn > Proto-Hnäzb) 

### Laryngeals
- ʡ > ʔ, or copies the value of a previous plain plosive (e.g. -pʡ- > -pp-)
- h > ∅ / in clusters

### Voiceless approximants
- w̥ l̥ ẙ > x ɬ ɕ

### Affricate genesis
- cl tl cʰɬ tʰɬ > tɬ tɬ tɬʰ tɬʰ
- cʰs tʰs > tsʰ
- cʰɕ tʰɕ > tɕʰ
- c cʰ > ts tsʰ
- t(ʰ) > tɬ(ʰ) / _u
- t(ʰ) > ts(ʰ) / _i
- k(ʰ) > tɕ(ʰ) / _i
- r̥s ɬs ss > ts
- r̥ɬ ɬɬ sɬ tl > tɬ
- ɬ s > tɬ ts / N_
- The previous change actually causes things like *sŋ̊ɬ- > *sŋ̊tɬ-, in which case everything before the affricate is deleted leaving *tɬ-
- Anything resulting like tsʰ-s just merges to tsʰ

### Ejective genesis
- (t)ɬ (t)s p t k q > tɬʼ tsʼ pʼ tʼ kʼ qʼ / _x₁; _x₂; _x₃
- pp tt tts ttɬ ttɕ kk qq > ppʼ ttʼ ttsʼ ttɬʼ ttɕʼ kkʼ qqʼ

### Sonorants
- Nasals assimilate to a following plosive, forming a geminate (e.g. -mpʰ- > -ppʰ-)
- m̥ n̥ ɲ̊ ŋ̊ > mp nt ntɕ nk / _#
- ɲ̊ ŋ̊ ɲ ŋ > n̥ n̥ n n
- w > ɰ
- r̥ r > χ ʁ

### Vowel colouring
- x₁ x₂ x₃ > i a u / not next to schwa
- ə > e / next to x₁
- ə > a / next to x₂
- ə > o / next to x₃
- x₁ x₂ x₃ > ∅ x χ / _V
- əy əw > ai̯ au̯

### Unstressed vowel shifts
- i, u > ɨ
- e ,o > ə
- ai̯ au̯ > i u

### Other vowel shifts

- ə > ɨ / stressed
- Vowels lengthen before a fricative at the end of a syllable
- i ɨ u ə > e a o a / next to uvulars

## Phonotactics

A syllable can contain both a complex onset and a complex coda, resulting in a maximal structure of CCVCC. 
All affricates > t / before another affricate or t
All aspirates unaspirate before another plosive and at the end of words.

## Accentuation 

Accent in Hnäzb is fixed on the ultimate syllable of the stem. Compounds bear their main accent on the first stem, while secondary stems are reduced (loss of long vowels, centralization). 

Secondary stress usually appears on the second-to-first syllable, while other prefixal syllables are reduced. 
# Nominal Morphology 
## Class
The older bipartite system of animate and inanimate is broken down into a tripartite system of **high-animate, low-animate** and **inanimate**. 
The categories of high-animate and low-animate descend from the categories of animate.singular and animate.plural respectively. 
They are similar to a distinction between humans and non-humans and in some Hnäzbic languages they are. However generally they don't map to these concepts precisely and low-animate is also used for groups of humans or generic terms like _man_ or _woman_ and others like that (False plurals and collectives).
The low-animate class can also be used derogatorily to insult people by likening them to animals. As the same time some instances of its use are to be understood as neutral and are just artefacts of its origin as animate.plural. Reversely the high-animate is also used on particular animals seen as noble creatures or mythical beings.

| Class         | Nouns                                                                                                | Origin           |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| High-Animate  | Humans (+ Names), deities + spirits, peoples and professions, some domestic animals (Ugo and cattle) | Animate.Singular |
| (Low)-Animate | Animals, some plants, machinery (human tools), natural phenomena, collectives, false plurals         | Animate.Plural   |
| Inanimate     | Most non-domesticated plants, places, objects, abstracts                                             | Inanimate        |

### Absolutive
The absolutive is used for the subject of intransitive verbs by all classes. Additionally it is also used for direct objects of transitive verbs in the Inanimate class. The low-animate class sees a certain fluctuation between the usage of the absolutive, the accusative and the partitive when being transitive object. This can depend on whether it is paired with another low-animate subject or a high-animate subject or whether it is singular or plural. This fluctuation eventually becomes fixed in later languages.
### Accusative
The accusative marks the direct object of transitive verbs. The low-animate class shows a distinction between singular and plural, by using the absolutive marker of the high-animate class for the singular and the old accusative marker for the plural. The Inanimate class has a higher degree of fluctuation. It mixes the paradigms of the absolutive, accusative and partitive. The old accusative makes the basis for the partitive, while singular inanimates seem to resort to zero marking, pluralic inanimate use the old absolutive marker. This pattern is highly unstable, as much as number marking during this stage.  
### Partitive
The partitive is a new case, which arose in Proto-Hnäzb. It is a sort of incomplete accusative which denotes indefinite, often pluralic, objects. It originates from a spread of the former inanimate accusative marker. The low-animate and inanimate class both use this class, while the high-animate uses its absolutive marker. The inanimate class can also use its old absolutive marker as partitive, although the pattern itself is not fixed at this stage.
### Ergative
The ergative marks the agent subject of a transitive verb. The high-animate and low-animate classes continue to use their inherited ergative suffix, while the inanimate class uses a former instrumental suffix. 
### Genitive
The Proto-Hnäzb genitive is an amalgamation of the former genitive and possessive cases. The genitive becomes a more generalised nominal connective marker, while the possessive, especially for singular high- and low-animates replaces the genitive largely. 
### Instrumental
The instrumental marks a tool or secondary participant and other adverbial functions. It remains largely unchanged, but also acquires more general roles. In some cases of the low-animate it can mark subjects of intransitive verbs and medial verbs. 
### Dative
The high-animate dative continues the old dative case, while the low-animate and inanimate datives goes back to former adessive case. The low-animate sometimes differentiates singular and plural by using either the old dative or the former adessive marker. 
### Locative
The older Koyanic locative first merged with the ablative and then was completely lost within the high- and low-animate classes. Only inanimate continue to distinguish between static locative and the ablative case. The animate locative is derived from the former animate.singular adessive case marker.
The old locative-ablative marker -sɨɬ can be found attached to certain noun-postposition constructions as linking element.
## Number
The formal distinction of singulars and plurals has been largely lost an renovated in the process of the development of Proto-Hnäzb. 

Various new plural suffixes developed out of old compounds and classifiers. 
## Classifiers and Pseudo-Compounds

Proto-Hnäzb developed a series of noun classifiers, which attach to nouns as suffixes. They are an addition to the class system and further subdivide nouns in various class. 

# Verbal Morphology 

Finite verbs in Hnäzb are mainly prefixing. The verbal root is the final part of the finite verb. It is preceded by a possible ventive or separative marker, a person-polarity-tense marker and a definiteness marker. 

| Definiteness | Person/Polarity/Tense | Version | Stem |
| ------------ | --------------------- | ------- | ---- |
## Ventive vs Separative stems 

Each verb has two stem forms. These stem forms are derived from former infixed person markers. These person markers differentiated the first person and the non-first person. These infixes were semantically bleached and became fixed to the stem. First as obligate prefixes and later as integral part of the stem, often being phonologically reduced to just a single consonant or vowel colouring. 

The first person markers became ventive forms, which represent something "away from the subject" or through the subject. Enacted by the subject, for the subject. The non-first person markers became separative markers, which means something from the outside towards the subject or something directed at the subject. The notion of the subject (or topic) replaces that of the first person, which is 

**Examples** 
(If there is no cluster and just a continuant and the vowel is either /a/ or /o/ it might be reanalysed as part of the prefix)

ʔotsʼ "to cook" > Ventive: ʔotsʼ "to cook for oneself/to cook something" (regular stem), Separative: ʔatsʼ "to cook for someone".   

kne "to cry" > Ventive: okne "to cry", Separative: akne "to lament" 

semt "to die" > Ventive: osemt "to die", Separative: asemt "to be killed" 

klat "to enjoy" > Ventive: oklat "to be happy", Separative: aklat "to enjoy something" 

χoː "to hear" > Ventive: χoː "to listen", Separative: χaː "to perceive audible" 

zai̯ "to see" > Ventive: zoi̯ "to watch", Separative: zai̯ "to perceive visually"

tau̯ "to speak" > Ventive otau̯ "to speak (to someone)", Separative: atau̯ "to speak in favour of someone/thing" 

naːq "to walk, to go" > Ventive: onaːq "to come", Separative: anaːq "to go away"

sm̥oːm "to urinate" > Ventive: osm̥oːm "to relieve oneself", Separative: asm̥oːm "to piss"

## Person Prefixes

Hnäzbic has person prefixes, which distinguish tense (past and non-past), as well as polarity (positive and negative).  The prefixes for the third person differentiate transitivity, while those of the first and second person do not. The third person singular remains null if the the verb is intransitive. If it is transitive it receives a prefix. This prefix however gets replaced by the definiteness marker if there is a definite object (though this might vary in daughter languages, depending on whether the prefix is reanalysed fully), with the polarity + number marker -(m)ər remaining. 

|          |     | 1SG    | 2SG            | 3SG            | 1PL          | 2PL            | 3PL            |
| -------- | --- | ------ | -------------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------------- | -------------- |
| Past     | -   | tʰokʰ- | pʰok-          | 0- / kʰə̄(ʔ)-  | tʰor-        | pʰor-          | 0- / kʰə̄ʔər-  |
|          | NEG | tʰom-  | pʰom-          | 0- / kʰə̄m-    | tʰomər-      | pʰomər-        | 0- / kʰə̄mər-  |
| Non-Past | -   | mi(n)- | simɨ-<br>simy- | sumɨ-<br>sumy- | ūmɨ-<br>ūmy- | somɨ-<br>somy- | zomɨ-<br>zomy- |
|          | NEG | om-    | onu-<br>onw-   | onɨ-<br>ony-   | omɨr-        | onur-          | onɨr-          |
## Definitenes Prefixes 

The final prefixes mark definiteness, meaning whether the verb has a definite or indefinite object. If the verb is intransitive, there is no prefix. If the verb is transitive and the object is indefinite and the subject is in the third person, there is a single prefix, which was previously shown as the third person marker. 
If the subject is first or second person and the object is indefinite there is no indefinite marker. If there is a definite object, a prefix is present. In the third person the prefix may replace the existing prefix (though this might vary in daughter languages, depending on whether the prefix is reanalysed fully). In the case of animate objects this distinction might be fuzzy and speakers might opt for an obligate prefix if the object is animate. 

**Animate Singular:** Before vowels: əkʰ-, Before consonants: kʰɨ-
**Animate Plural:** Before vowels: ət-, Before consonants: tɨ-
**Inanimate:** kʰūʔ-
