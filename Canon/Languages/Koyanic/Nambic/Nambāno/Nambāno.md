**Nambāno** is a Namb dialect cluster spoken throughout the [[Qnōp']] lowlands in the first and second millennia AGS.
# Phonology
## Consonants
|                     | -   | Labial | Alveolar | Palatal | Plain dorsal | Labialised dorsal |
| ------------------- | --- | ------ | -------- | ------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| Voiced obstruent    | -   | b      | d        | j       | g            | gu /gʷ/           |
| Voiceless plosive   | -   | p      | t        |         | k            | ku /kʷ/           |
| Voiceless fricative | -   |        | s        |         | (h)          | (hu /hʷ/)         |
| Nasal               | -   | m      | n        |         | [ŋ]          |                   |
| Trill               | -   |        | r        |         |              |                   |
| Approximant         | -   |        | l        |         | j            |                   |
### h and hu
In addition to this core inventory of consonants, *h* and *hu* /hʷ/ typically appear in the popular literary language Standard Nambāno. These consonants were present in [[Old Nambāno]] but became less commonly pronounced throughout the first millennium AGS, though remained distinct in the native orthography.

*h* is most typically completely elided, while *hu* is pronounced [w]. They may be pronounced [h] and [ʍ] respectively in initial positions, especially at the beginning of an utterance or as a deliberate choice in formal settings, but never intervocalically.
## Vowels

|       | -   | Front | Back |
| ----- | --- | ----- | ---- |
| Close | -   | i ī   | o ō  |
| Open  | -   | e ē   | a ā  |
The short close back vowel /o/ is realised as [o] in most environments, but always [u] when following a labialised dorsal consonant, in which case the consonant is delabialised, i.e. /gʷo kʷo hʷo/ are pronounced [gu ku (h)u]. /o/ can additionally be realised as [u] in any environment in fast speech, especially at the end of a word.

When two vowels meet at a morpheme boundary within a word, they coalesce into a single vowel according to the table shown below:

|        | -   | -i, -ī | -e, -ē | -o, -ō | -a, -ā |
| ------ | --- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| i-, ī- | -   | ī      | ē      | io     | ē      |
| e-, ē- | -   | ē      | ^      | ō      | ^      |
| o-, ō- | -   | ^      | ^      | ^      | ō      |
| a-, ā- | -   | ^      | ^      | ^      | ā      |
The exception is the vowel sequence *io*, which may be considered the only diphthong in Nambāno, typically pronounced [iu̯].
### Nasal vowels
Some language varieties in the Nambāno dialect cluster such as [[Tazoku]], as well as less related languages like [[Afãba]], feature nasalised vowels, retained from the ancestral language [[Old Nambāno]]. These consonants are sometimes written in Standard Nambāno, particularly in older texts, though no variety of Nambāno Proper retains the nasalisation. Nambāno itself is sometimes spelt ⟨NA-AM-BA-AN-NO⟩ (c.f. Old Nambāno \*namb-ãnu).
## Phonotactics
The grammarian tradition and native orthography of Nambāno demonstrate a separation of the syllable into an onset cluster and a rhyme consisting of a vowel and optional coda consonant. Any combination of onset and rhyme can form a valid syllable.
### Onset
Onset clusters of certain consonants with medial /m n r l/ can occur in the syllable onset, as shown in the table below:

|     | -   | b-  | d-  | g-  | p-  | t-  | k-  | s-  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| -m- | -   |     | dm- | gm- |     | tm- | km- | sm- |
| -n- | -   | bn- |     | gn- | pn- |     | kn- | sn- |
| -r- | -   | br- | dr- | gr- | pr- | tr- | kr- | sr- |
| -l- | -   | bl- |     | gl- | pl- |     | kl- | sl- |
### Rhyme
The syllable rhyme can either be a monomoraic short vowel, or one of six kinds of bimoraic segment, shown below:
- **Long vowel** — Each of the four vowels /a e i o/ has a long form /aː eː iː oː/.
- **Assimilating nasal** — /n/ can occur in coda position only if followed by another consonant, in which position it assimilates to the place of articulation of that consonant.
- **Bilabial nasal** — Unlike /n/, /m/ can occur in word-final position and does not assimilate to alveolar consonants, though still becomes /n/ [ŋ] before dorsal plosives /g(ʷ) k(ʷ)/, even across word boundaries.
- **Geminate** — All consonants except /h hʷ/ can be geminated, with some geminates having unique phonetic qualities:
	- /-s-/ [s] vs. /-s.s-/ [-t.t͡s-]
	- /-j-/ [j] vs. /-j.j-/ [-ɟ.ɟ͡ʝ-]
- **Bilabial plosive** — A bilabial plosive /b p/ can occur preceding an alveolar obstruent. The voicedness of the coda matches the following onset, giving the possible clusters /-bd- -pt- -ps-/. Like the bilabial nasal /m/, the bilabial plosive assimilates to a following dorsal plosive /g(ʷ) k(ʷ)/.
- **Lateral** — The lateral approximant /l/ can also appear as coda, being pronounced as a voiceless fricative [ɬ] before a voiceless consonant and, very rarely, in word-final position, the only consonant other than /m/ to appear in that position.
## External sandhi
Many sandhi process apply to consonants and vowels at the word boundaries.
### Initial h and hu
Initial *h* and *hu* have a geminating effect on preceding consonants.
> *am hē, jesi rāsēnaha nam*
> [am‿meː je.s‿raː.seː.naː nam]
> "Five things, of which I know three"

> *huam huāmōtī*
> [wam‿maː.moː.tiː]
> "The traveller then arrived"
### Final consonants
Word-final consonants *-m*, *-l* and *-r* lend themselves to the onset of a following vowel-initial syllable.
> *hal ōmōdam ōhānēnō*
> [(h)a.l‿oː.moː.da.m‿oː.aː.neː.noː]
> "The people meet with their lord"

A small handful of common words have special forms with a final *-n* that can optionally arise when preceding a vowel, *h* or *hu*, for example the popular first person singular pronoun *sī* has the alternate form *son*.
> *smipnē sī io* or *smipnē son io*
> [smi.pneː siː i.o] or [smi.pneː so.n‿i.o]
> "I'm scared"

> *sī hatō rē* or *son hatō rē*
> [siː a.toː reː] or [son‿na.toː reː]
> "I see the sun"

*-m* also exhibits regular assimilation to velar consonants.
> *am kuarasa*
> [aŋ kʷa.ra.sa]
> "Five soldiers"
### Final vowels
Some, but not all instances of final *-a* may be elided before a following vowel or liquid in fast speech. Common examples include the countable absolutive suffix and the formal first person plural or gender-neutral first person singular pronoun *epa*.
> *sihua ōhesī*
> [si.w‿oː.e.siː]
> "The chicken is sleeping"

> *hō epa rio*
> [(h)oː e.p‿riu̯]
> "We're here (we have arrived)"

*-i* can be similarly elided, but only before liquids.
> *seti ranī Siguontō*
> [se.t‿ra.niː si.gun.toː]
> "Where is Uhustaw?"
# Grammar
Nambāno is a fairly agglutinative language in which most words consist of several morphemes, though monomorphemic function words are among the most common words. Most content words are formed with derivational suffixes which determine their inflectional properties.

Nambāno nouns are categorised into four classes based on their numerosity, a property which determines which grammatical number they may take:
- **Countable** — Can take all three grammatical numbers, singular, plural and numberless.
- **Uncountable** — Only has a numberless form.
- **Individual** — Always singular.
- **Numerous** — Either singular or plural.

Number is not overtly marked on nouns, rather verbs exhibit pluractionality, meaning they mark the plurality of their subject. Pluractionality is marked in a variety of ways, the most common of which is with an infix *-r-*. For example, the two primary copulaic verbs *onō* and *huinō* have second/third person singular forms *mī* and *huī*, and plural forms *grī* and *rī* respectively.
> *Hēsintō huī otma mī Jarrā*
> `Oksandanderi.ABS  exist.IND.2/3SG  river.ABS  be.IND.2/3SG  Yarla.ABS`
> "The [[Yarla]] is a river in [[Oksandanderi]]"

> *Tannatō rī otma grī Mibassam Tmohassā*
> `Tannato.ABS  exist.IND.2/3PL  river.ABS  be.IND.2/3PL  Mibassa.COM  Tmohassa.ABS`
> "The [[Mibassa]] and [[Tmohassa]] are rivers in [[Tannato]]"
