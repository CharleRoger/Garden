**Old Nambāno**, also known as **Early Nambāno** or **Proto-Nambāno**, is the ancestor of most language varieties within the [[Nambāno]] dialect cluster, believed to be the oldest [[Koyanic languages|Koyanic language]] spoken in [[Qnōp']].

### Palatal obstruent
The palatal obstruent \*j was likely a fricative [ʝ] or affricate [ɟʝ], though may have already been pronounced as an approximant [j] as it is most typically in [[Nambāno]].

| Mid   | -   | \*e \*ē \*ẽ  |             | \*o \*ō \*õ |
| Open  | -   |              | \*a \*ā \*ã |             |

Long vowels derive primarily from compensatory lengthening via two sources:
- Loss of coda \*h, itself a merger of older [[Proto-Namb language|Proto-Namb]] \*f and \*x.
- Loss of coda \*r.

Five of the six vowels additionally had nasalised forms, \*ã \*ẽ \*ĩ \*õ \*ũ. These resulted from loss of nasals at the end of words and before older fricatives and nasals, also lengthening the vowel, with the nasalised form of \*ɨ merging with \*ã. The bilabial nasal \*m, however, was retained in these environments. Coda \*n was restored by loss of final \*-ɨ after nasals and liquids, meaning nasalised vowels contrasted with vowel + \*-n sequences.

In addition to the monophthongs, three diphthongs are found in Old Nambāno, \*ei, \*ou and \*iu.

## Phonotactics
Old Nambāno had a maximal CCVC syllabic structure, with various constraints placed on the onset cluster and coda consonant.
### Onset
Medial nasals in the onset could not have the same place of articulation as a preceding plosive, thus \*bn- and \*tŋʷ- are allowed onset clusters while \*bm- and \*tn- are forbidden.

The plain velar consonants \*g \*k \*h \*ŋ could occur preceding any vowel except \*u \*ū \*ũ, where they are neutralised into a labialised velar + \*ɨ. The exact pronunciation of these syllables is not entirely reconstructible, e.g. it is not known whether \*gʷɨ was actually [gʷɨ] or [gu], but it is reconstructed as such due to the later [[Nambāno]] form *gua* [gʷa] reflecting the regular \*ɨ > a shift seen elsewhere.
### Coda
Obstruents could occur in coda position, though not at the end of words, but the labialised velars \*gʷ \*kʷ \*hʷ \*ŋʷ were not allowed in the coda.
### Consonant clusters
Consonant clusters most typically arise at morpheme boundaries, since most underlying stems end in a consonant which resolves into one of the five rhymes when placed before an obstruent. Various morphophonological processes of assimilation limited the possible \*-BB- clusters that were possible that could occur across syllable boundaries. These processes can be sorted into progressive and regressive assimilation:
- **Progressive assimilation**
	- The velar fricative \*h(ʷ) assimilates to any preceding consonant, e.g. \*-th- \*-ŋh- \*-rh- > \*-tt- \*-ŋŋ- \*-rr-.
		- \*hʷ additionally causes a preceding bilabial consonant to shift to a labialised velar, thus \*-mhʷ- \*-bhʷ- \*-phʷ- > \*-ŋŋʷ- \*-ggʷ- \*-kkʷ-.

- **Regressive assimilation**
	- Plosives assimilate to following nasals of the same place of articulation, e.g. \*-pm- \*-dn- \*-kŋ- > \*-mm- \*-nn- \*-ŋŋ-.
	- Labial stops \*b \*p \*m assimilate to following velar stops, e.g. \*-bg- \*-pk- \*-mgʷ- > \*-gg- \*-kk- \*-ŋgʷ-.
	- Lingual nasals \*n \*ŋ assimilate to the place of articulation of any following consonant, e.g. \*-nk- \*-ŋn- \*-ŋb- > \*-ŋk- \*-nn- \*-mb-. Note that \*m only assimilated to velar consonants as per the rule above, thus labial-alveolar sequences like \*-mt- and \*-ml- were allowed.
	- Lingual plosives \*d \*t \*g \*k assimilate to the place of articulation and voicedness of any following plosives, \*s and \*j, e.g. \*-dp- \*-gs- \*-tj- > \*-pp- \*-ss- \*-jj-.

# Grammar
## Nouns
### Number
The basic form of all nouns is the "uncounted" form, which can represent a generic plural or generic reference to a type or category. Most nouns were countable, exhibiting a "counted" form of certain grammatical cases, which was singular by default but could take modifiers to specify quantity, such as numerals.
### Case
Nouns have seven basic cases: absolutive, accusative, oblique, dative, comitative, ergative-genitive and ablative. An eighth case, the possessive, appears on exclusively animate nouns.

Some examples of the inflection of countable and uncountable nouns are shown in the tables below.

## Verbs
Verbs have three underlying stems:
- **Basic** — Used to form the indicative and the gerund.
- **Subjunctive** — Used to form subjunctive and jussive forms of the verb, marked with a nasalised vowel + \*-hʷ.
- **Modal** — Used to form aspectual derivations of the verb, typically marked by a fronted stem vowel and ending in \*-i or \*-ei.

The three stems can have alternation between their final vowels. The subjunctive and modal stems can be regularly derived from the basic stem, as shown in the table below, where C represents some number of consonants.

| Basic stem | Subjunctive stem | Modal stem |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ---------- |
| \*-iC-     | \*-iCãhʷ-        | \*-iCi-    |
| \*-ɨC-     | ^                | ^          |
| \*-uC-     | \*-uCãhʷ-        | ^          |
| \*-aC-     | \*-aCãhʷ-        | \*-eCi-    |
| \*-oC-     | ^                | ^          |
| \*-i-      | \*-Cĩhʷ-         | \*-is-     |
| \*-ɨ-      | \*-ãhʷ-          | \*-i-      |
| \*-u-      | \*-ũhʷ-          | ^          |
| \*-e-      | \*-ẽhʷ-          | \*-ei-     |
| \*-a-      | \*-ãhʷ-          | ^          |
| \*-o-      | \*-õhʷ-          | ^          |

The modal stem also typically featured a modification of stem-final consonants, and sometimes the lengthening or nasalisation of the stem vowel. Most verbs followed a regular alternation pattern, shown in the table below.

| hʷ                               | hʷ                   | ^                    |

The modal stem alternation could often obscure its relation to the basic stem, even following the regular pattern. For example, compare the basic/modal stem pairs: \*ɨnn-/\*ĩsi- "to die"; \*pug-/\*pis- "to squeeze"; \*hɨb-/\*hips- "to cut".
### Gerund
The citation form of the verb is the gerund, an uncounted noun formed by adding the suffix \*-nō to the basic stem.
### Jussive
The jussive is a form of the verb used with second and third person subjects to express commands and exhortations. It is formed by adding the suffix \*-na to the subjunctive stem which regularly deletes its final \*-hʷ, for example the verb \*kehʷinō has the subjunctive stem \*kehʷĩhʷ- and jussive \*kehʷĩna. An archaic suffix \*-nɨ originally distinguished an imperative used specifically to issue commands to the second person, but this was lost by the extension of the usage of \*-na.
### Person agreement
Verbs in the indicative and subjunctive mood take one of two suffixes which agree with the person of the subject; there are two forms which mark the first or second/third person. The indicative mood is formed by adding a person suffix to the basic stem, while the subjunctive mood uses the same suffixes on the subjunctive stem. The form of a suffix can change depending on a preceding vowel, as shown in the table below.

| Base vowel | First person | Second or third person |
| ---------- | ------------ | ---------------------- |
| ∅, ɨ       | \*-a         | \*-ɨ̄/ū                |
| e, i       | \*-ē         | ^                      |
| u          | \*-ō         | ^                      |
| a, o       | \*-o         | \*-ō                   |
### Verb prefix
Old Nambāno verbs could take an optional prefix consisting of two parts:
- Relative tense marker, either present \*r-, past \*hʷ-, or unmarked \*∅-
- Emphasis marker, either unemphatic \*-ō- or emphatic \*-ã-/\*-ãn-/\*-an-
When not marked for tense, the unemphatic prefix is used for conditionals and periphrastic future tense, while the emphatic prefix takes a negative meaning.

The unemphatic prefix can be dropped if the temporal context is already established.
### Pluractionality
Plurality is not marked on nouns, but rather by pluractionality of the verb, meaning the form of the verb expresses the plurality of its subject. A pluractional verb implies that the subject, which must be in the "counted" absolutive case, consists of a plural group of subjects which are each taking part in the verb individually. A non-pluractional verb can still be used with a noun representing a group, but this implies the group acting as a whole in the action.

Verbs use various mechanisms for marking pluractionality which are not predictable or necessarily regular. These can be sorted into four categories, listed below in order of frequency:
- Partial reduplication with a centralised vowel
	- \*liŋkim- → \*lɨliŋkim- "become improved"
	- \*pleŋi- → \*pableŋi- "pray, hope for"
	- \*knohar- → \*kagnohar- "rot, spoil"
- Insertion of the infix ⟨r⟩
	- \*gonn- → \*gronn- "be known, familiar"
	- \*hemsi- → \*remsi- "be ploughed"
	- \*ãna- → \*rãna- "see"
- Addition of the prefix j(ɨ)-
	- \*kepan- → \*jɨkepan- "be tattooed"
	- \*nēsle- → \*jɨnēsle- "be cleared, excavated"
	- \*ambagēd- → \*jambagēd- "be sacrificed"
- Various idiosyncratic cases
	- \*tiŋgān- → \*tɨlliŋgān- "be isolated, far away"
	- \*drãh- → \*narrãh- "be tied, tangled"
	- \*nuŋg- → \*rumb- "be gathered up"
### Irregular verbs
Some Nambāno verbs do not follow a fully regular pattern of conjugation, though generally the verb prefix is always regularly attached even to irregular verbs.

Some examples of common irregular verbs are shown in the table below.

| Meaning | -   | Gerund   | Indicative | <     | <     | <     | Subjunctive | <        | <        | <         | Jussive | <       | Modal stem |
| ------- | --- | -------- | ---------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----------- | -------- | -------- | --------- | ------- | ------- | ---------- |
| ^       | -   | ^        | 1sg        | 1pl   | 2/3sg | 2/3pl | 1sg         | 1pl      | 2/3sg    | 2/3pl     | sg      | pl      | ^          |
| To say  | -   | \*tuhãnō | \*ta       | \*tra | \*tū  | \*trū | \*tõhʷa     | \*trõhʷa | \*tõhʷɨ̃ | \*trõhʷɨ̃ | \*tũna  | \*trũna | \*tehʷi    |

Perhaps the three most common verbs in Old Nambāno are the three "copulas", which are the only verbs to feature irregular prefixed forms, though the initial relative tense-marking prefix (present \*r-, past \*hʷ-) still regularly applies.
#### Equative copula \*unō
The first copula is the equative copula **\*unō**, which has a highly irregular conjugation in both the indicative and subjunctive.

It additionally features a distinct pluractional form in the second/third person.


|             | <          | -   | 1sg        | 1pl        | 2/3sg              | 2/3pl     |
| ----------- | ---------- | --- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------------ | --------- |
| Indicative  | Bare       | -   | \*ŋʷa      | \*hʷɨ      | \*ŋʷɨ̄, \*gʷɨ̄     | \*grū     |
| ^           | Unemphatic | -   | \*-ōhʷa    | \*-ōhʷɨ    | \*-ohʷɨ̄           | \*-orɨ̄   |
| ^           | Emphatic   | -   | \*-ãhʷa    | \*-ãhʷɨ    | \*-ãŋʷɨ̄, \*-ãgʷɨ̄ | \*-ãgrū   |
| Subjunctive | Bare       | -   | \*jūhʷa    | \*jūhʷɨ    | \*jũhʷɨ̄           | \*rũna    |
| ^           | Unemphatic | -   | \*-ohʷãhʷa | \*-ohʷãhʷɨ | \*-ohʷãhʷɨ̄        | \*-orũna  |
| ^           | Emphatic   | -   | \*-ãnũhʷa  | \*-ãnũhʷɨ  | \*-ãnũhʷɨ̄         | \*-ãdrũna |
| Jussive     | <          | -   |            |            | \*jũna             |           |

#### Attributive copula \*hʷinō
The second copula is the attributive copula **\*hʷinō**, which attributes circumstantial properties, including locative and possessive uses, and also features pluractionality. The conjugation is essentially regular, except for the rare first person singular and plural forms \*-i and \*-iu respectively.

|             | <          | -   | 1sg        | 1pl        | 2/3sg       | 2/3pl     |
| ----------- | ---------- | --- | ---------- | ---------- | ----------- | --------- |
| Indicative  | Bare       | -   | \*hʷi      | \*riu      | \*hʷɨ̄      | \*rū      |
| ^           | Unemphatic | -   | \*-ōhʷi    | \*-ōhʷiu   | \*-ohʷɨ̄    | \*-orɨ̄   |
| ^           | Emphatic   | -   | \*-ãhʷi    | \*-ãhʷiu   | \*-ãnū      | \*-ãdrū   |
| Subjunctive | Bare       | -   | \*hʷĩhʷa   | \*hʷĩhʷɨ   | \*hʷĩhʷɨ̄   | \*rĩna    |
| ^           | Unemphatic | -   | \*-ōhʷĩhʷa | \*-ōhʷĩhʷɨ | \*-ōhʷĩhʷɨ̄ | \*-ōrĩna  |
| ^           | Emphatic   | -   | \*-ãhʷĩhʷa | \*-ãhʷĩhʷɨ | \*-ãhʷĩhʷɨ̄ | \*-ãdrĩna |
| Jussive     | <          | -   |            |            | \*hʷĩna     |           |
#### Stative copula \*einō
The third "copula", **\*einō**, is not a copula in the strict sense, rather it describes states of existence, usually temporary or involving actions performed by the subject, often taking a gerund as direct object. When used intransitively, takes the meaning "to be present" or "to exist".

|             | <          | -   | 1         | 2/3        |
| ----------- | ---------- | --- | --------- | ---------- |
| Indicative  | Bare       | -   | \*io      | \*ēlō      |
| ^           | Unemphatic | -   | \*-eso    | \*-eslō    |
| ^           | Emphatic   | -   | \*-ãnila  | \*-ãlō     |
| Subjunctive | Bare       | -   | \*ãhʷa    | \*ãhʷɨ̄    |
| ^           | Unemphatic | -   | \*-ōhʷa   | \*-ōhʷɨ̄   |
| ^           | Emphatic   | -   | \*-ãnãhʷa | \*-ãnãhʷɨ̄ |
| Jussive     | <          | -   |           | \*ãna      |
