The **Proto-Namb language** (abbreviated **PNmb**), also known as **Proto-Northern Gäj** is the reconstructed ancestor of the [[Nambāno]] and [[Arklobu]] language clusters, which together form the Northern branch of the "Gäj" languages, a primary subgroup of the [[Koyanic languages|Koyanic language family]].

The alveolar plosives \*d \*t were likely dental [d̪ t̪].

Some analyses of Proto-Namb consider the sequences \*gw \*kw \*xw \*ŋw to be a class of singular labialized velar consonants.

## Vowels
### Monophthongs

|       | -   | Unrounded | Rounded |
| ----- | --- | --------- | ------- |
| Close | -   | \*i       | \*u \*ü |
| Mid   | -   | \*e \*ë   | \*o \*ö |
| Open  | -   | \*a \*ä   |         |

The vowel system of Proto-Namb features a typical five-vowel system, \*a \*e \*i \*o \*u, in which the vowels \*a \*e \*o \*u had additional mutated forms, transcribed \*ä \*ë \*ö \*ü respectively, which arose in the early development of Namb as allophones triggered by the presence of \*i in the following syllable. These mutated vowels were initially entirely morphologically conditioned, though by the time of Proto-Namb proper, the true ancestor of all Namb languages, the distinction between them and their plain counterparts had become fully phonemic. The loss of \*i in certain environments and analogical extension of mutated vowels to forms which never had a following \*i yielded phonemic mutated vowels in other phonological environments, and the shift of [[Proto-Gäj language|Proto-Gäj]] \*ē to \*i produced non-mutating instances of \*i.

Namb languages typically exhibit separate shifts between plain and mutated vowels, though certain pairs can be merged. \*e and \*ë are reconstructed as separate sounds, suggesting that \*e likely had a central or back quality [ə~ɤ]. The other vowel pairs are usually interpreted similarly, with a back or central quality in the plain vowel and a fronted form in the mutated vowel:
- a e o u [a~ɑ ə~ɤ o u]
- ä ë ö ü [æ e ø y]

It has also been suggested that \*ä \*ë \*ö \*ü were not fronted, but rather had an advanced tongue root, as is exhibited in [[Qachkav]] vowel harmony. This theory posits the following approximate vowel qualities:
- a e o u [ɑ ɛ ɔ ʊ]
- ä ë ö ü [a e o u]
### Diphthongs
In addition to the monophthongs, the vowel sequences \*ie and \*ue are reconstructed to have acted like singular diphthongal vowels. These diphthongs derive primarily from three sources:
- [[Proto-Gäj language|Proto-Gäj]] \*ī and \*ū
- \*i and \*u before \*r
- \*i and \*u + any mid or open vowel (\*e \*ë \*a \*ä \*o \*ö)

Their reflexes in [[Nambāno]] suggest that \*ue also had an i-mutated form, transcribed \*üe, though it does not have distinct reflexes in other [[Namb languages]] so is not easily reconstructible.
# Grammar
## Stem alternation
[[Proto-Gäj language|Proto-Gäj]] featured a pattern of grammatical alternation in which the last vowel of a stem is ablauted in certain forms of both nouns and verbs according to the following rules:
- -æ- -ǣ- -a- -ā- → -a-
- -e- -ē- -i- -ī- → -i-
- -o- -ō- -u- -ū- → -u-

In other grammatical forms, a stem-final consonant would mutate according to the rule:
- -b -d -j -g -r -y -w → -p -t -c -k -s -∅ -∅

In Namb, this latter process developed further due to the loss of \*s between vowels, palatal obstruent assimilation and i-mutation, whereby the vowels \*a \*e \*o \*u were shifted to \*ä \*ë \*ö \*ü respectively in the presence of \*i or \*y in the next syllable.

These changes yielded the following mutation rules which generally apply in Proto-Namb:
- -b -d -j/g/k -x → -p -t -c -ç
- -r -y -w → -∅
- -a- -e- -o- -u- → -ä- -ë- -ö- -ü-

This mutation is not restricted to a single lexical class, all three alternating stem forms appear in the inflection of both nouns and verbs. Zero-derivation makes this especially clear, as the same stems can lend themselves to unrelated grammatical forms in different lexical classes, for example those shown in the table below.

| Stem     | -   | Verb "give"          | Noun "gift"     |
| -------- | --- | -------------------- | --------------- |
| Basic    | -   | \*leda (IND.1SG)     | \*leda (ABS.SG) |
| Mutated  | -   | \*lëti (INFV)        | \*lëtiex (ERG)  |
| Ablauted | -   | \*lidanfa (SUBJ.1SG) | \*lidux (OBL)   |

The ablauted stem is used in compounding.

There are six morphological paradigms relating the forms of the three stems and suffixes attached to the stem. These stem classes are defined by whether or not the stem ends in a consonant or vowel and which of three cardinal vowels appears as the final vowel in the ablauted stem.

|          | -   | aC-stem | <   | <   | iC-stem | <    | <   | uC-stem | <    | <   | a-stem              | i-stem | u-stem |

| Mutated  | -   | -äC     | -ëC | -öC | -iC     | -ieC | -ëC | -üC     | -üeC | -öC | ^                   | ^      | ^      |
| Ablauted | -   | -aC     | <   | <   | -iC     | <    | <   | -uC     | <    | <   | -a                  | -i     | -u     |

### Development from Proto-Gäj
The uniformity of stem alternation across lexical class is the result of inflectional morphology coincidentally causing multiple independent sound changes to frequently occur together, and the compound phonological variation which arose becoming recognised as a common pattern. This separated a stem into distinct forms strengthened by semantic and morphological analogy. For example, the [[Proto-Gäj language|Proto-Gäj]] infinitive suffix \*-xi, which formed the basis of the imperfective verb conjugation in Proto-Namb, triggered mutation of the previous vowel in the stem and blocked the voicing of a stem-final plain plosive which had become voiced elsewhere. In nominal inflection, the [[Proto-Gäj language|Proto-Gäj]] genitive suffix \*-(r)i (< \*-z/si) also triggered the same ablaut and consonant mutation in most cases, as did the ablative suffixes \*-çi and \*-θi.

Many paradigms of related forms which partially or inconsistently mutated the stem were analogically levelled into systems based around canonical alternating stems. For example, the ergative singular suffix \*-iax triggered the voicing of a previous obstruent in [[Proto-Gäj language|Proto-Gäj]], as in \*mæŋgiax "cat-ERG.SG" from [[Proto-Koyanic language|PKn]] \*mx₁ə́ŋkīx₂(ə)r̥, but in Proto-Namb the i-mutation of the stem vowel from \*a to \*ä and palatalisation of \*g to \*j caused the ergative to be identified with other case forms which had historically blocked the voicing. Thus, the actual Proto-Namb reflex is not *\*\*mäɲjiex* as would be expected from regular sound change, but \*mäɲciex by analogy with \*mäɲci (ERG.PL, GEN.PL, ABL).

The semantic relationships between nominal cases may also have influenced this analogy. There may have been a semantic split into indirect relational roles like the genitive and ablative, and direct passive/recipient roles like the absolutive and accusative. In such a system, the ergative case would likely be more associated with the relational roles, and this may have influenced the use of this mutated stem for the ergative case in Proto-Namb, unlike the other [[Gäj languages]].
## Nouns
### Grammatical number
Proto-Namb features two true grammatical numbers, singular and plural, which have different inflectional forms and corresponding verb affixes. Additionally, there is a "numberless" category, which is not strictly a grammatical number, but a form of a noun which carries no number and cannot be modified by quantifiers. When numbered and numberless nouns appear together within a discourse, the numberless noun typically has an indirect or adjunct role. Numberless nouns can be the subject of a verb, though it is not known whether the verb was marked for a singular or plural subject in such a case, as descendant languages exhibit different behaviour.

Mass nouns appear only in the numberless form, typically representing things like substances, emotions and weather events.

Some nouns have a suppletive numberless form, such as \*adera "human", which has the plural \*adere "humans" but numberless \*gacmafor "humanity" rather than the expected \*\*adror. Likewise, \*\*gacmafa and \*\*gacmafe are similarly unattested.
### Case
Nouns in Proto-Namb inflect for seven cases:
- **Absolutive** — The subject of a stative or active verb, or patient of a passive verb
- **Accusative** — The object of an active verb
- **Oblique** — With an obligatory postposition, marks various other instrumental, circumstantial and spatial roles
- **Possessive** — A special case found only on animate nouns, marking an elevated or asymmetrical possessive relationship with another noun
- **Ergative** — The agent of a passive verb
- **Genitive** — Generic adnominal relation
- **Ablative** — With or without a postposition, marks certain other oblique roles

The oblique and ablative cases, which are the only cases to take postpositions, are strictly always in the uncounted grammatical number and thus cannot take quantifiers directly.
### Declensions
The case-marking systems of Proto-Namb can be categorised according to the six stem classes.

#### a-stem declension (\*ŋaŋa "frog")
The a-stem declension takes the same absolutive, accusative and ergative case endings as a C-stem noun, but features distinct oblique and relative stem forms. The ergative case, though exhibiting the vowel \*-i- on each suffix, notably does not feature i-mutation of the preceding vowel. This is because the ergative singular

When compounding, the linking vowel \*-a- is used, but the oblique stem exhibits the vowel \*-u- before the case ending.

### Unique nouns
Certain temporal and spatial nouns, as well as uniquely named entities like deities, celestial bodies and months, fall into a special category of "unique" nouns. Many of these were derived from the [[Proto-Koyanic language|Proto-Koyanic]] inanimate locative \*-tʰul and ablative \*-tʰīl, with \*-tʰ (later \*-f) reanalysed as part of the stem in Namb. Unique nouns take numberless inflectional forms, but are treated as singular by verb agreement. The typical accusative suffix \*-ax is not present, instead the oblique \*-xu is used, which triggers assimilation of the common stem-final \*f to \*x

### Irregular nouns
Other than some suppletive numberless forms and irregularity in the oblique stem, nominal inflection is highly regular across the case paradigm. The very few irregularities which do exist are almost exclusively represented by variation between stem forms, e.g. the irregular noun \*fierra "road", which has ablauted and mutated stems \*faŋ- and \*fin- respectively.

## Verbs
### Nonfinite verbs
Two nonfinite verb forms exist, the **gerund** and the **infinitive**.

The gerund is an uncountable a-stem noun formed with the suffix \*-na, which serves as the citation form of the verb, despite being the only form which is not actually a verb. The declension of the gerund is shown in the table below.

| Basic stem    | Absolutive | -   | \*-nor  |
| ------------- | ---------- | --- | ------- |
| ^             | Accusative | -   | \*-nax  |
| Ablauted stem | Oblique    | -   | \*-naxu |
| Mutated stem  | Ergative   | -   | \*-nier |
| ^             | Ablative   | -   | \*-nöi  |
| ^             | Genitive   | -   | \*-nöri |

The infinitive is formed with the suffix \*-(ç)i attached to the mutated stem. The presence of \*-ç- is determined by the final segment of the stem, as shown in the table below.

| Mutated stem     | Infinitive |
| ---------------- | ---------- |
| \*-p             | \*-pç      |
| \*-t             | \*-t       |
| \*-c             | \*-c       |
| \*-f, \*-x, \*-ç | \*-çç      |
| \*-m             | \*-mç      |
| \*-n, \*-ɲ, \*-ŋ | \*-ɲç      |
| \*-ä             | \*-äi      |
| \*-i             | \*-içi     |
| \*-ü             | \*-üi      |
### Finite verbs
The morphological structure of a finite verb in Proto-Namb adheres to the following template:

| Prefix | Root | Motive | Voice | Mood and ending |
| ------ | ---- | ------ | ----- | --------------- |
#### Aspect
Verbs do not carry lexical aspect and are perfective in their basic form, with imperfective aspects expressed periphrastically with an auxiliary verb and the main verb in the infinitive.
#### Voice
Central to the Proto-Namb verb system is the extensive voice paradigm, in which the relationship between the subject and the action can be specified by various suffixes and phrasal constructions.

Almost all verbs in Proto-Namb can be classified into categories based on their intrinsic voice:
- **Passive** — Follows an ergative alignment, taking an absolutive subject and non-obligatory ergative agent. Tends to prefer agent-object-verb order.
- **Active** — Follows a nominative alignment, taking an absolutive object and non-obligatory accusative object. Tends to prefer subject-verb-object order.
- **Intransitive** — Takes only an absolutive subject. Any additional arguments must use the oblique or ablative cases.
- **Impersonal** — Does not take a subject.

The most common category is the passive verb, while true intransitive and impersonal verbs are rare. It is possible for passive and active verbs to be used intransitively, i.e. taking an absolutive subject alone, but it is not possible to use the ergative and accusative cases with verbs other than their respective classes.

The voice system can be understood as the absolutive case representing a promotion of one of the four other adverbial cases to the role of subject. A given verb has prototypical roles for those four cases, some examples of which include:
- **Accusative** — Object, patient, recipient.
- **Ergative** — Agent, cause.
- **Oblique** — Indirect object, benefactor, goal, purpose, certain instruments etc.
- **Ablative** — Circumstance, source, location, cause, certain other instruments, etc.

The active voice can then be described as the voice that promotes the prototypical ergative to the absolutive subject, while the passive voice promotes the accusative to subject. A given verb doesn't necessarily have associated roles for all of these cases, e.g. intransitive verbs have either no ergative or no accusative in their imaginary default case-role system. "Default" here is perhaps strange, since any actual realisation of the verb must promote one of these to the absolutive case.

Excluding intransitive and impersonal verbs, Proto-Namb has seven reconstructible verb voices, though it is not known if all were operational simultaneously or how they fit together into a single paradigm, as the system appears to have been somewhat open and continuously evolving. The typical constructions of these voices, and the type of verbs they could operate on, are shown in the table below:

| Intrinsic class   | Voice             | -   | Marker             | Absolutive               | Ergative | Accusative |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | --- | ------------------ | ------------------------ | -------- | ---------- |
| Passive           | Passive           | -   | Unmarked           | Promoted from accusative | Agent    | -          |
| ^                 | Passive causative | -   | \*-tlu-            | Promoted from ablative   | Cause    | -          |
| ^                 | Active            | -   | \*-a-              | Promoted from ergative   | -        | Object     |
| Active            | Active            | -   | Unmarked           | Promoted from ergative   | -        | Object     |
| Passive or active | Unaccusative      | -   | \*-am-             | Promoted from accusative | -        | -          |
| Any               | Active causative  | -   | \*-fa-             | Promoted from ablative   | Cause    | -          |
| ^                 | Applicative       | -   | \*-era-            | Promoted from oblique    | Agent    | Object     |
| ^                 | Circumstantial    | -   | Infinitive + \*ul- | Promoted from ablative   | Agent    | Object     |
The circumstantial voice is notably not formed with a suffix, but with the auxiliary verb \*ul- "be put in place" and the main verb in the infinitive.

Some time after the establishment of roughly the above system, another auxiliary verb, ostensibly of the underlying form \*-a-, came to be used to form passive voices on an active verb. The source of this verb was likely either [[Proto-Koyanic language|Proto-Koyanic]] \*sə "become" or \*sə̄- "bear", with a shift in meaning to "undergo" in Namb and eventual semantic bleaching. The two most readily reconstructible uses of this auxiliary are in forming the passive and unaccusative voices:
- **Passive** — Infinitive + \*a- or the extended form \*aŋk-, from an otherwise unattested suffix \*-ŋk. Relation to the intransitive verb \*ŋok- "go" has been suggested.
- **Unaccusative** — Infinitive + \*om-, likely from [[Proto-Gäj language|Proto-Gäj]] \*ām- < \*a-am-.
- **Passive causative** — Infinitive + \*atlu-.

Since the infinitive was also used to form imperfective moods, these constructions also took on a basic imperfective aspect. Evidence from [[Nambāno]] suggests that the auxiliary \*-a- was similarly used to yield imperfective forms of the unaccusative and applicative voices on passive verbs.
#### Mood
Verbs distinguish two moods, **indicative** and **subjunctive**. The indicative stem is the unmarked, basic stem of the verb, while the subjunctive stem is the ablauted stem plus the suffix \*-an, which takes the form \*-n on vowel-final stems.

The ending of the verb depends on the mood and agrees with the person of the subject. The typical forms of the verb endings are shown in the table below.

|             | Stem class | -   | 1sg      | 2sg      | 3sg      | 1pl      | 2pl      | 3pl      |
| ----------- | ---------- | --- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Indicative  | aC, iC, uC | -   | \*-a     | \*-a-f   | \*-a-x   | \*-u     | \*-u-f   | \*-u-x   |
| ^           | a          | -   | \*-o     | \*-o-f   | \*-o-x   | \*-ou    | \*-ou-f  | \*-ou-x  |
| ^           | i          | -   | \*-ie    | \*-ie-f  | \*-ie-x  | \*-iu    | \*-iu-f  | \*-iu-x  |
| ^           | u          | -   | \*-ue    | \*-ue-f  | \*-ue-x  | \*-u     | \*-u-f   | \*-u-x   |
| Subjunctive | VC         | -   | \*-an-fa | \*-an-na | \*-an-ta | \*-an-çu | \*-an-ne | \*-an-te |
| ^           | V          | -   | \*-n-fa  | \*-n-na  | \*-n-ta  | \*-n-çu  | \*-n-ne  | \*-n-te  |
