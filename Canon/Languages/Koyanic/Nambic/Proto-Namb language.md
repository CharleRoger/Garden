The **Proto-Namb language** (abbreviated **PNmb**), also known as **Proto-Northern Gäj** is the reconstructed ancestor of the [[Nambāno]] and [[Arklobu]] language clusters, which together form the Northern branch of the "Gäj" languages, a primary subgroup of the [[Koyanic languages|Koyanic language family]].

The alveolar plosives \*d \*t were likely dental [d̪ t̪].

Some analyses of Proto-Namb consider the sequences \*gw \*kw \*xw \*ŋw to be a class of singular labialized velar consonants.

## Vowels
### Monophthongs

|       | -   | Unrounded | Rounded |
| ----- | --- | --------- | ------- |
| Close | -   | \*i       | \*u \*ü |
| Mid   | -   | \*e \*ë   | \*o \*ö |
| Open  | -   | \*a \*ä   |         |

The vowel system of Proto-Namb features a typical five-vowel system, \*a \*e \*i \*o \*u, in which the vowels \*a \*e \*o \*u had additional mutated forms, transcribed \*ä \*ë \*ö \*ü respectively, which arose in the early development of Namb as allophones triggered by the presence of \*i in the following syllable. These mutated vowels were initially entirely morphologically conditioned, though by the time of Proto-Namb proper, the true ancestor of all Namb languages, the distinction between them and their plain counterparts had become fully phonemic. The loss of \*i in certain environments and analogical extension of mutated vowels to forms which never had a following \*i yielded phonemic mutated vowels in other phonological environments, and the shift of [[Proto-Gäj language|Proto-Gäj]] \*ē to \*i produced non-mutating instances of \*i.

Namb languages typically exhibit separate shifts between plain and mutated vowels, though certain pairs can be merged. \*e and \*ë are reconstructed as separate sounds, suggesting that \*e likely had a central or back quality [ə~ɤ]. The other vowel pairs are usually interpreted similarly, with a back or central quality in the plain vowel and a fronted form in the mutated vowel:
- a e o u [a~ɑ ə~ɤ o u]
- ä ë ö ü [æ e ø y]

It has also been suggested that \*ä \*ë \*ö \*ü were not fronted, but rather had an advanced tongue root, as is exhibited in [[Qachkav people]] vowel harmony. This theory posits the following approximate vowel qualities:
- a e o u [ɑ ɛ ɔ ʊ]
- ä ë ö ü [a e o u]
### Diphthongs
In addition to the monophthongs, the vowel sequences \*ie and \*ue are reconstructed to have acted like singular diphthongal vowels. These diphthongs derive primarily from three sources:
- [[Proto-Gäj language|Proto-Gäj]] \*ī and \*ū
- \*i and \*u before \*r
- \*i and \*u + any mid or open vowel (\*e \*ë \*a \*ä \*o \*ö)

Their reflexes in [[Nambāno]] suggest that \*ue also had an i-mutated form, transcribed \*üe, though it does not have distinct reflexes in other [[Namb languages]] so is not easily reconstructible.
# Grammar
## Stem alternation
[[Proto-Gäj language|Proto-Gäj]] featured a pattern of grammatical alternation in which the last vowel of a stem is ablauted in certain forms of both nouns and verbs according to the following rules:
- -æ- -ǣ- -a- -ā- → -a-
- -e- -ē- -i- -ī- → -i-
- -o- -ō- -u- -ū- → -u-

In other grammatical forms, a stem-final consonant would mutate according to the rule:
- -b -d -j -g -r -y -w → -p -t -c -k -s -∅ -∅

In Namb, this latter process developed further due to the loss of \*s between vowels, palatal obstruent assimilation and i-mutation, whereby the vowels \*a \*e \*o \*u were shifted to \*ä \*ë \*ö \*ü respectively in the presence of \*i or \*y in the next syllable.

These changes yielded the following mutation rules which generally apply in Proto-Namb:
- -b -d -j/g/k -x → -p -t -c -ç
- -r -y -w → -∅
- -a- -e- -o- -u- → -ä- -ë- -ö- -ü-

This mutation is not restricted to a single lexical class, all three alternating stem forms appear in the inflection of both nouns and verbs. Zero-derivation makes this especially clear, as the same stems can lend themselves to unrelated grammatical forms in different lexical classes, for example those shown in the table below.

| Stem     | -   | Verb "give"          | Noun "gift"     |
| -------- | --- | -------------------- | --------------- |
| Basic    | -   | \*leda (IND.1SG)     | \*leda (ABS.SG) |
| Mutated  | -   | \*lëti (INFV)        | \*lëtiex (ERG)  |
| Ablauted | -   | \*lidanfa (SUBJ.1SG) | \*lidux (OBL)   |

The ablauted stem is used in compounding.

There are six morphological paradigms relating the forms of the three stems and suffixes attached to the stem. These stem classes are defined by whether or not the stem ends in a consonant or vowel and which of three cardinal vowels appears as the final vowel in the ablauted stem.

|          | -   | aC-stem | <   | <   | iC-stem | <    | <   | uC-stem | <    | <   | a-stem              | i-stem | u-stem |

| Mutated  | -   | -äC     | -ëC | -öC | -iC     | -ieC | -ëC | -üC     | -üeC | -öC | ^                   | ^      | ^      |
| Ablauted | -   | -aC     | <   | <   | -iC     | <    | <   | -uC     | <    | <   | -a                  | -i     | -u     |

### Development from Proto-Gäj
The uniformity of stem alternation across lexical class is the result of inflectional morphology coincidentally causing multiple independent sound changes to frequently occur together, and the compound phonological variation which arose becoming recognised as a common pattern. This separated a stem into distinct forms strengthened by semantic and morphological analogy. For example, the [[Proto-Gäj language|Proto-Gäj]] infinitive suffix \*-xi, which formed the basis of the imperfective verb conjugation in Proto-Namb, triggered mutation of the previous vowel in the stem and blocked the voicing of a stem-final plain plosive which had become voiced elsewhere. In nominal inflection, the [[Proto-Gäj language|Proto-Gäj]] genitive suffix \*-(r)i (< \*-z/si) also triggered the same ablaut and consonant mutation in most cases, as did the ablative suffixes \*-çi and \*-θi.

Many paradigms of related forms which partially or inconsistently mutated the stem were analogically levelled into systems based around canonical alternating stems. For example, the ergative singular suffix \*-iax triggered the voicing of a previous obstruent in [[Proto-Gäj language|Proto-Gäj]], as in \*mæŋgiax "cat-ERG.SG" from [[Proto-Koyanic language|PKn]] \*mx₁ə́ŋkīx₂(ə)r̥, but in Proto-Namb the i-mutation of the stem vowel from \*a to \*ä and palatalisation of \*g to \*j caused the ergative to be identified with other case forms which had historically blocked the voicing. Thus, the actual Proto-Namb reflex is not *\*\*mäɲjiex* as would be expected from regular sound change, but \*mäɲciex by analogy with \*mäɲci (ERG.PL, GEN.PL, ABL).

The semantic relationships between nominal cases may also have influenced this analogy. There may have been a semantic split into indirect relational roles like the genitive and ablative, and direct passive/recipient roles like the absolutive and accusative. In such a system, the ergative case would likely be more associated with the relational roles, and this may have influenced the use of this mutated stem for the ergative case in Proto-Namb, unlike the other [[Gäj languages]].
## Nouns
### Grammatical number
Proto-Namb features two true grammatical numbers, singular and plural, which have different inflectional forms and corresponding verb affixes. Additionally, there is a "numberless" category, which is not strictly a grammatical number, but a form of a noun which carries no number and cannot be modified by quantifiers. When numbered and numberless nouns appear together within a discourse, the numberless noun typically has an indirect or adjunct role. Numberless nouns can be the subject of a verb, though it is not known whether the verb was marked for a singular or plural subject in such a case, as descendant languages exhibit different behaviour.

Mass nouns appear only in the numberless form, typically representing things like substances, emotions and weather events.

Some nouns have a suppletive numberless form, such as \*adera "human", which has the plural \*adere "humans" but numberless \*gacmafor "humanity" rather than the expected \*\*adror. Likewise, \*\*gacmafa and \*\*gacmafe are similarly unattested.
### Case
Nouns in Proto-Namb inflect for seven cases:
- **Absolutive** — The subject of a stative or active verb, or patient of a passive verb
- **Accusative** — The object of an active verb
- **Oblique** — With an obligatory postposition, marks various other instrumental, circumstantial and spatial roles
- **Possessive** — A special case found only on animate nouns, marking an elevated or asymmetrical possessive relationship with another noun
- **Ergative** — The agent of a passive verb
- **Genitive** — Generic adnominal relation
- **Ablative** — With or without a postposition, marks certain other oblique roles

The oblique and ablative cases, which are the only cases to take postpositions, are strictly always in the uncounted grammatical number and thus cannot take quantifiers directly.
### Declensions
The case-marking systems of Proto-Namb can be categorised according to the six stem classes.

#### a-stem declension (\*ŋaŋa "frog")
The a-stem declension takes the same absolutive, accusative and ergative case endings as a C-stem noun, but features distinct oblique and relative stem forms. The ergative case, though exhibiting the vowel \*-i- on each suffix, notably does not feature i-mutation of the preceding vowel. This is because the ergative singular

When compounding, the linking vowel \*-a- is used, but the oblique stem exhibits the vowel \*-u- before the case ending.

### Unique nouns
Certain temporal and spatial nouns, as well as uniquely named entities like deities, celestial bodies and months, fall into a special category of "unique" nouns. Many of these were derived from the [[Proto-Koyanic language|Proto-Koyanic]] inanimate locative \*-tʰul and ablative \*-tʰīl, with \*-tʰ (later \*-f) reanalysed as part of the stem in Namb. Unique nouns take numberless inflectional forms, but are treated as singular by verb agreement. The typical accusative suffix \*-ax is not present, instead the oblique \*-xu is used, which triggers assimilation of the common stem-final \*f to \*x

### Irregular nouns
Other than some suppletive numberless forms and irregularity in the oblique stem, nominal inflection is highly regular across the case paradigm. The very few irregularities which do exist are almost exclusively represented by variation between stem forms, e.g. the irregular noun \*fierra "road", which has ablauted and mutated stems \*faŋ- and \*fin- respectively.
