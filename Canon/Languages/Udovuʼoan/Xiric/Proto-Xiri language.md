The **Proto-Xiri language** is the hypothetical reconstructed common ancestor of all language varieties in the [[Xiri]] dialect cluster, forming the largest branch of the [[Udovuʼoan languages]]. While Proto-Xiri itself is strictly unattested, it very closely resembles [[Old Xiri]], an actual language stage spoken in the [[1st millennium BGS]], attested in the earliest writing on the islands in the [[Ugugo#Origin and evolution|Savamāric Ugugo]] abjad.

# Phonology

## Consonants

|             | -   | Labial | Alveolar | Post-alveolar | Velar | Uvular | Glottal |
| ----------- | --- | ------ | -------- | ------------- | ----- | ------ | ------- |
| Nasal       | -   | **\*m**    | **\*n**      | **\*ñ**           | **\*ń**   |        |         |
| Plosive     | -   | **\*p**    | **\*t**      | **\*c**           | **\*k**   | **\*q**    | **\*ʼ**     |
| Fricative   | -   | **\*f**    | **\*s**      | **\*x**           |       |        | **\*h**     |
| Approximant | -   | **\*w**    | **\*l**      | **\*y**           |       |        |         |

The consonant inventory matches closely to the set of 15-16 consonants used in early versions of the [[Ugugo]]. The presence of the uvular plosive \*q in particular is suggested by a unique letter in very early [[Old Xiri]] inscriptions, labelled ⟨Q⟩, which quickly fell out of use as it merged with \*k and \*ʼ.

One notable feature of the consonant inventory of Proto-Xiri is the presence of the post-alveolar fricative \*ʃ, the result of a sound change from \*k before the vowel \*i which is not attested in [[Old Xiri]] texts.

\*ɲ is generally considered a single consonant in Proto-Xiri, though the earliest transcriptions of [[Old Xiri]] record it as the sequence ⟨N-Y⟩, i.e. /nj/, or simply ⟨N⟩.

## Vowels

Proto-Xiri is reconstructed with five monophthongal vowels with contrastive length, a stable system which survived into most later varieties. This system is, however, not thought to have existed in [[Old Xiri]], which more likely had a system like /i ɨ u ai a au/ or /i ə u e a o/, though this is less certain than even the reconstruction of Proto-Xiri.
