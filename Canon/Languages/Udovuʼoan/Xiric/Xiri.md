**Xiri** is a dialect continuum containing many of the most spoken languages in [[Udovuʼo]] throughout history. The varieties of Xiri are thought to have developed from a single common ancestor, [[Proto-Xiri language|Proto-Xiri]], to which the attested language [[Old Xiri]] bares strong resemblance.

This article focuses on Standard Xiri, a variety originating from [[Erido]] which was prescribed as a standard language and acted as a lingua franca for much of [[Xiyeru]] history, before it was replaced by [[Ahōtoli]] under the [[Xiyeru Confederation]].

# History

The history of Xiri as a separate language, distinct from the other varieties of [[Udovuʼo]], begins some time in the [[3rd century BGS]] and extends throughout the [[1st millennium|1st millennium AGS]]. Various changes to the language occurred throughout this time, many of which were due to influence from [[Low Alöbi]].

## Historical stages

Xiri is typically considered in two major historical stages: **Early** and **Late Xiri**, with the historical dialect **Exodus Xiri** also regarded an important variant.

### Early Xiri

The earliest stage of the language which is distinct from its sister languages, spoken from c. 300 BGS until around 100-300 AGS. Canonical Early Xiri is often taken as the state of the language immediately before the first contact with the [[Low Alöbi|Alöbi]]-speaking [[Öb]] people, which occurred in the [[1st century|1st century AGS]].

### Late Xiri

After first contact with [[T'ugü]], Xiri underwent various changes, many of which were influenced by continued contact throughout most of the [[Horizon period]].

### Exodus Xiri

Exodus Xiri was a divergent Late Xiri dialect, the particular variant of Xiri spoken by [[Xiyeru]] refugees arriving in [[T'ugü]] after the [[Exodus period#The Great Sickness (655 AGS)|Great Sickness in 655]] and subsequently throughout the [[Exodus Period]]. This stage of the language was strongly influenced by [[Low Alöbi]] and had already begun mixing into what would later become [[Möxali]]. Exodus Xiri may have been distinct enough from the contemporary Xiri still spoken in [[Udovuʼo]] to consider it a distinct language, and may instead be thought of as a very early stage of [[Möxali]] before it had fully matured.

## Phonological evolution

### Sound changes from Proto-Xiri

Loss of short \*e after a continuant, except in initial syllables:

- e > ∅ after nasals
	- \*lame > \*lam > *rham* "glue"
	- \*kane > *kan* "emotion"
- e > ∅ after fricatives except h
	- \*tēfe > *tēf* "bone"
	- \*ca-nese > *canes* "to leave"
- e > ∅ after glides
	- \*ńa-ʼaye > *ńaʼay* "tattoo"
	- \*fewe > \*few > *hew* "life"

Chain shift \*q > \*k > \*x [ʃ] before \*i \*ī:

- k > x before i ī
	- \*liki > \*riki > \*rixi > *rhiži* "section"
	- \*fakia > \*faxia > *hažo* "crop"
- q > k before i ī
	- \*āuqi > \*ōqi > \*ōki > *ōgi* "bug"

Merger of \*q into ʼ elsewhere

- \*qaca > \*ʼaca > *ʼaja* "elbow, knee";

Monophthongisation of closing diphthongs:

- ai āi > e ē
	- \*waiʼa > *weʼa* "river"
- au āu > o ō
	- \*ʼihau > \*ʼiho > *ʼiyo* "command"
	- \*āuqi > \*ōqi > *ōgi* "bug"
- ei ēi > i ī
	- \*eici > \*ici > *iji* "pig"
	- \*c-asēi > \*c-asī > *cazi* "change"
- eu ēu > u ū
	- \*ʼēu > *ʼū* "one"

Dissimilation of opening diphthongs:

- ia iā > yo yā
	- \*fakia > \*faxia > \*faxyo > *hažo* "crop"
	- \*piāʼe > pyāʼe > *pyaʼe* "fruit"
- ua uā > wa wā
	- \*kuasi > \*kwasi > *kwazi* "obsidian"
- ie iē > yu yē
	- \*tieʼi > \*tyuʼi > *cuʼi* "hook"
	- \*niēle > \*nyēle > *ñēre* "tear, rain"
- ue uē > wi wē
	- \*kue > *kwi* "yam"
	- \*pa-luēki > \*pa-luēxi > \*pa-lwēxi > *farēži* "touch"

Rhotacisation of \*l:

- \*lame > \*lam > \*ram > *rham* "glue"
- \*pa-luēki > \*pa-lwēki > \*pa-rwēki > *farēži* "touch"
- \*niēle > \*nyēle > \*nyēre > *ñēre* "tear, rain"

Loss of \*h:

- \*hiti > \*iti > *idi* "tree"
- \*ʼihau > \*ʼiho > \*ʼio > *ʼiyo* "command"

Chain shift \*f \*p > \*h \*f in word-initial position before vowels, i.e. where there is no medial glide:

- f > h word-initially
	- \*fewe > \*few > *hew* "life"
	- \*fakia > \*faxo > \*haxo > *hažo* "crop"
- p > f word-initially
	- \*posi > \*fosi > *fozi* "wisdom"
	- \*p(a)- > *f(a)-* "transitive prefix"

### Active sound changes in Early Xiri

These sound changes occurred later in history, changing vocab diachronically and remaining active throughout the Early Xiri period, with newly coined words also exhibiting the changes. This means that an Early Xiri word which had historically undergone alveolar palatalisation, like \*nyēre > *ñēre*, can still undergo glide metathesis: *saw-ñēre* > *sañwēre*.

Epenthesis of glides between a close vowel and another following vowel:

- i ī > iy īy before vowels
	- \*ʼihau > \*ʼio > *ʼiyo* "command"
	- \*xi-eru > *xiyeru* "[[Xiyeru]]"
- u ū > uw ūw before vowels
	- \*ūhi > \*ūi > *ūwi* "big"

Metathesis of glides before consonants:

- yC > Cy
	- \*ńa-ʼaye-posi > \*ńaʼayposi > \*ńaʼapyosi > *ńaʼapyozi* "tattoo-wisdom"
- wC > Cw
	- \*sew-pi > *sepwi* "third"
	- \*saw-ñēre > *sañwēre* "summer rain"

Note that this rule started to become inactive during the time of Early Xiri as coda glides were lost via monophthongisation of /ej ew aj aw/ to [iː ɵː ɛː ɒː]. For example, /tʃaʔew/ "to peel" + /-ta/ "adj." yielded [tʃaʔɵːd̪a], rendered *caʼeuda* or *caʼōda* in the native orthography, rather than the older expected form \*caʼetwa.

Palatalisation of alveolars:

- ny > ñ [ɲ]
	- \*niēle > \*nyēre > *ñēre* "tear, rain"
- ty > c [tʃ]
	- \*tieʼi > \*tyuʼi > *cuʼi* "hook"
- sy > x [ʃ]
	- \*ńaʼay-sa > \*ńaʼasya > \*ńaʼaxa > *ńaʼaža* "non-tattooed person"

Deletion of glides following certain consonants:

- y, w > ∅ after f, x, h, c, r, ʼ
	- \*pa-lwēki > \*farwēxi > \*farēxi > *farēži* "touch"
	- \*saw-heʼi > *saheʼi* "summer blossom"

Voicing of obstruents between vowels

- p > b between vowels
	- \*ūpa > *ūba* "sun, day"
- t > d between vowels
	- \*pa-tana > \*fatana > *fadana* "lead"
- c [tʃ] > j [dʒ] between vowels
	- \*eici > \*ici > *iji* "pig"
- k > g [ŋ] between vowels
	- \*āuqi > \*ōki > *ōgi* "bug"
- f > v between vowels
	- \*lafau > \*lafo > *lavo* "foreign, different"
- s > z between vowels
	- \*pausi > \*fosi > *fozi* "knowledge"
- x [ʃ] > ž [ʒ] between vowels
	- \*liki > \*rixi > \*riži > *rhiži* "section"
- The rhotic /r/ also split into [ɾ] between vowels and [ɹ] elsewhere, romanised as *rh*
	- \*lame > \*ram > *rham* "glue"
	- \*liki > \*riži > *rhiži* "section"

This final change is generally not phonemic, meaning the newly formed voiced consonants were intervocalic allophones of their unvoiced counterparts. The exception is *g*, which phonologically merged into /ŋ/, but is romanised as such to mirror the native script which tended to continue writing these voiced-*k* instances of /ŋ/ the same as unvoiced /k/.

# Phonology

## Consonants

|             | -   | Labial        | Alveolar               | Postalveolar            | Velar     | Glottal   |
| ----------- | --- | ------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- | --------- | --------- |
| Nasal       | -   | **m**         | **n**                  | **ñ** [ɲ]               | **ń** [ŋ] |           |
| Plosive     | -   | **p** (**b**) | **t** (**d**)          | **c** [tʃ] (**j** [dʒ]) | **k**     | **ʼ** [ʔ] |
| Fricative   | -   | **f** (**v**) | **s** (**z**)          | **x** [ʃ] (**ž** [ʒ])   |           | **h**     |
| Approximant | -   | **w**         | **rh** [ɹ] (**r** [ɾ]) | **y** [j]               |           |           |

- *n* and *t* are dental [n̪] and [t̪~d̪] respectively.
- Medial glides are not pronounced as separate consonants, but expressed as labialisation or palatalisation of the preceding consonant, e.g. kwi [kʷi] "yam".
- *p t c k f s x rh* are allophonically shifted to *b d j g v z ž r* [b d dʒ ŋ v z ʒ ɾ] intervocalically.
	- The voiced allophones are distinguished in romanisation, but not in the native orthography.
	- When underlying *k* is voiced to [ŋ] and thus neutralised with *ń*, it is still written as ⟨K⟩ in the native orthography and romanised as *g* to reflect this. Lexical items commonly have fossilised \*k→ŋ still spelt as though it were [k], e.g. *saga* [saŋa] "foreigner", from older \*saka.
	- Medial glides blocked this voicing, e.g. *pwa* [pʷa] "island" → *upwa* [upʷa] "islands", not \*ubwa.

## Vowels

|       | -   | Front          | Central        | Back           |
| ----- | --- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Close | -   | **i ī** [i iː] |                | **u ū** [u uː] |
| Mid   | -   | **e ē** [e eː] |                | **o ō** [o oː] |
| Open  | -   |                | **a ā** [a aː] |                |

Vowel length was contrastive on all five vowels in Early Xiri:

- *ka* "breeze" / *kā* "wood"
- *e* "from, by" / *ē* "and, then, thus"
- *iji* "pig" / *īji* "black, dark"
- *so* "fruit" / *sō* "blue, green"
- *fu* "there, that" / *fū* "but, except"

## Syllable structure

The syllable onset could take a single consonant, with some initials allowing a medial glide *y* or *w*.

Nine consonants could appear in coda position: *m n ń f s x h y w*. The glides *y w* could only occur as coda following *e a*, yielding the combinations *ey ew ay aw*, with the vowel pronounced long and the sequences acting as single bimoraic vowels [ei̯ eu̯ ai̯ eu̯]. Coda nasals were only expressed as consonants if a following word began with a vowel, otherwise they were elided and pronounced as nasalisation of the preceding vowel.

Consonants were never geminated, if a coda came into contact with an identical onset, they were merged into a single consonant, e.g. /teːf/ *tēf* "bone" + /fes/ *fes* "river fish" → /teːfes/ *tēves* "fish sp.".

Some examples of all possible syllable shapes are shown in the table below:

| Syllable shape | -   | Word         | Meaning                 |
| -------------- | --- | ------------ | ----------------------- |
| V              | -   | *ī* [iː]     | dark; hand, foot; thing |
| CV             | -   | *ye* [je]    | plant                   |
| CyV            | -   | *myo* [mʲo]  | among                   |
| CwV            | -   | *kwi* [kʷi]  | yam                     |
| (C)VN          | -   | *fāń* [fãː]  | moon                    |
| (C)VG          | -   | *hew* [heu̯] | life                    |
| (C)VF          | -   | *tēf* [teːf] | bone                    |

## Stress

The standard dialect has a fairly regular stress pattern in which disyllabic words containing place the stress on the second syllable, while longer words stress the second syllable. Monosyllables may be stressed or unstressed depending on the word and its use within the discourse, grammatical particles are usually unstressed. Every second syllable after the main stressed syllable also receives a weaker secondary stress. Inflectional suffixes, such as the accusative *-yo*, also affect the stress. Some examples are shown in the table below:

| Word                           | Meaning              |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| *kwi* [kʷi]; *kwiyo* [ˈkʷijo]  | yam.NOM; night.ACC   |
| *uʼo* [ˈuʔo]; *uʼoyo* [uˈʔojo] | night.NOM; night.ACC |
| *ʼurazi* [ʔuˈɾazi]             | knife                |
| *āńurōgi* [aːˈŋuɾoːˌŋi]        | insect sp.           |

Certain clitic-like grammatical segments do not affect stress, such as the plural markers *u-* and *ugu-*. For example, *[[udovuʼo]]* has the stress on the third syllable [u.doˈvu.ʔo], not the second as would be expected from the regular stress placement rule.

# Grammar

*See also: [[Xiri grammar]]*

Xiri is primarily an SVO language, though changing word order has grammatical function and any word order can be used to express different meanings. Dependent clauses are always verb-initial, either VOS or VSO, while passive constructions always place the verb at the end of the phrase, either SOV or OSV.

The morphology of Xiri is agglutinative, meaning words are formed by sequences of distinct morphemes which each serve a single grammatical function. Most words typically consist of 1-4 morphemes.

Nouns have three main cases, nominative, accusative and genitive, with the genitive case able to take various extra affixes to express locative, dative, instrumental, equative and comitative subcases. A kind of plurality can be marked on nouns with the prefix *u-*/*w-*, though is not used regularly to refer to plural entities and so is perhaps more like a collective noun derivation than a regular inflection.

Transitivity on verbs is unusually marked by an obligatory prefix, *f(a)-* on transitive verbs and *c(a)-* on intransitive verbs. Verbs can take one of several aspectual suffixes, while tense can be marked by the use of the auxiliary verbs *no* (past) and *ci* (future). Verbs do not mark any agreement with their subject. A large, closed set of particles is used to express various grammatical moods and types of evidentiality, some of which can be combined to form more specific meanings.
