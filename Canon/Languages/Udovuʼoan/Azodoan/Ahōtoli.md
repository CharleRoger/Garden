**Ahōtoli**, called *Azodori* in [[Xiri]], is an [[Udovuʼoan languages|Udovuʼoan language]] language originating on the large southern island of [[Udovuʼo]], called *[[Azodo]]* in [[Xiri]] and *Ahōto* in Ahōtoli.

After the [[Exodus period|Xiyeru exodus]] to [[T'ugü]] at the end of the [[7th century]], Ahōtoli quickly took over as the lingua franca in [[Udovuʼo]] under the influence of the [[Azodo Government]], and in the following centuries became the most widely spoken [[Udovuʼoan languages|Udovuʼoan language]] in history with the expansion of the [[Xiyeru Confederation]].

## Lack of labial consonants

Ahōtoli exhibits the labialised velar consonants /kʷ/ and /w/, but a complete lack of pure labial consonant phonemes, an extremely uncommon feature cross-linguistically. The postulated sound changes which deleted all of [[Proto-Xiri language|Proto-Xiri's]] labial consonants \*m, \*p and \*f are listed below:

- w → kʷ / #\_
- m p f → w\~ŋ kʷ\~k w / \_u
- m p f → n t s / \_i
- m p f → w w w / V\_V
- m p f → n h ∅

All dialects of [[Udovuʼo]] experienced centuries of influence from [[Xiri#Standard Xiri|Standard Xiri]] which directed them along convergent evolutionary paths, but Ahōtoli appears to have resisted the adoption of bilabial consonants due to conscious social factors. Culture in [[Azodo]] had historically been more isolationist than the other islands, and when [[Xiri]] first began to spread to [[Azodo]], children were often discouraged from speaking with labial consonants outside of specific situations which required the use of the [[Xiri]] language. [[Xiri|Xiri's]] most common consonant /f/ was considered particularly obnoxious to many people, perhaps owing to its abundant use as a grammatical prefix on verbs which was not present in Ahōtoli. The *[[Weweneʼă]]* "cultivation of proper speech", a [[5th century]] Ahōtoli text outlining the differences between the language and [[Xiri#Standard Xiri|Standard Xiri]], calls the f- glyphs of the [[Ugugo]] script "as pointless as they are loathsome", and describes [[Xiri|Xiri's]] /f/ as "a wholly useless sound which may carry no meaning, and whose use signifies witlessness and a lack of self-cognisance".

After Ahōtoli was popularised throughout the other islands in the [[8th century|8th]] and [[9th century|9th]] centuries AGS, labial consonants became associated with "improper" dialects, and even became somewhat taboo in some more formal contexts. Despite this, [m] was not uncommon to hear among the speech of even the most well-spoken individuals as a realisation of utterance-initial /w/, or for some speakers in free variation with /ŋ/ before close back vowels (*ŭ u ū*).

## Vowels

|       | <           | -   | Front         | Central       | Back          |
| ----- | ----------- | --- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Close | Long        | -   | **ī** [iː]    |               | **ū** [uː]    |
| ^     | Short       | -   | **i** [i]     |               | **u** [u]     |
| ^     | Extra-short | -   | **ĭ** [ĭ\~ɪ̆] |               | **ŭ** [ŭ\~ʊ̆] |
| Open  | Long        | -   | **ē** [ɛː]    | **ā** [aː]    | **ō** [ɔː]    |
| ^     | Short       | -   | **e** [ɛ]     | **a** [a]     | **o** [ɔ]     |
| ^     | Extra-short | -   |               | **ă** [ă\~ɐ̆] |               |

The extra short vowels (*ĭ ă ŭ*) are never stressed and typically realised with slightly centralised vowel qualities [ɪ ɐ ʊ], while the long vowels (*ē ō ī ū*) sometimes have a slight degree of diphthongisation for some speakers [ɛːɐ̯ ɔːɐ̯ iːɘ̯ uːɘ̯]. The reason for analysing the extra short vowels as a separate vowel length rather than simply short vowels /ɪ ɐ ʊ/ of a different quality is related to the distribution and alternation between the different vowel lengths, as well the fact that Ahōtoli can be analysed as a mora-timed language, where the three vowel lengths have one, two and three morae.

## Stress

Stress falls on the first short or long syllable, never on an extra short syllable. There exist many pairs of words contrasted by stress and the distinction between the extra short and short vowel length:

- *hańă* [ˈhaŋɐ̆] "Bigmoon, night" ~ *hăńa* [hɐ̆ˈŋa] "nose, protrusion"
- *yakĭ* [ˈjakɪ̆] "smart, witty" ~ *yăki* [jɐ̆ˈki] "now"
- *uxĭ* [ˈuʃɪ̆] "these (things)" ~ *ŭxi* [ʊ̆ˈʃi] "east"
