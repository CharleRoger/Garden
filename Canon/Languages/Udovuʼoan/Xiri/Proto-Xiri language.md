The **Proto-Xiri language** is the hypothetical reconstructed common ancestor of all language varieties in the [[Xiri]] dialect cluster, forming the largest branch of the [[Udovuʼoan languages]]. While Proto-Xiri itself is strictly unattested, it very closely resembles [[Old Xiri]], an actual language stage spoken in the [[1st millennium BGS]], attested in the earliest writing on the islands in the [[Ugugo#Origin and evolution|Savamāric Ugugo]] abjad.

# Phonology

## Consonants

|             | -   | Labial | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Uvular | Glottal |
| ----------- | --- | ------ | -------- | ------- | ----- | ------ | ------- |
| Nasal       | -   | \*m    | \*n      | \*ɲ     | \*ŋ   |        |         |
| Plosive     | -   | \*p    | \*t      | \*tʃ    | \*k   | \*q    | \*ʔ     |
| Fricative   | -   | \*f    | \*s      |         |       |        | \*h     |
| Approximant | -   | \*w    | \*l      | \*j     |       |        |         |

The consonant inventory matches closely to the set of 15 consonants used in the earliest version of the [[Ugugo]]. The presence of the uvular plosive \*q in particular is suggested by a unique letter in very early [[Old Xiri]] inscriptions, labelled ⟨Q⟩, which quickly fell out of use as it merged with \*k. \*q is thus reconstructed for Proto-Xiri, and is useful in explaining the development of later /k/ and /ʃ/. 

\*ɲ is generally considered a single consonant in Proto-Xiri, though the earliest transcriptions of [[Old Xiri]] record it as the sequence ⟨N-Y⟩, i.e. /nj/, or simply ⟨N⟩.

## Vowels

Proto-Xiri is reconstructed with five monophthongal vowels with contrastive length, a stable system which survived into most later varieties. This system is, however, not thought to have existed in [[Old Xiri]], which more likely had a system like /i ɨ u ai a au/ or /i ə u e a o/, though this is less certain than even the reconstruction of Proto-Xiri.
