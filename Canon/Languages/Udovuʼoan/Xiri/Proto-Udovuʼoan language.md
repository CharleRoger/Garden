The **Proto-Udovuʼoan language** is the hypothetical reconstructed common ancestor of all native languages of [[Udovuʼo]], believed to have been spoken no later than 3000 BGS.
# Phonology

## Consonants

|             | -   | Labial | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Uvular | Glottal |
| ----------- | --- | ------ | -------- | ------- | ----- | ------ | ------- |
| Nasal       | -   | \*m    | \*n      |         | \*ŋ   |        |         |
| Plosive     | -   | \*p    | \*t      | \*c     | \*k   | \*q    | \*ʔ     |
| Fricative   | -   | \*f    | \*s      |         |       |        | \*h     |
| Approximant | -   | \*w    | \*l      |         |       |        |         |
The consonant \*c may have been a post-alveolar affricate [tʃ], the most common realisation in descendant languages, though some varieties suggest an archaic palatal quality.
## Vowels

### Monophthongs
The monophthongs of Proto-Udovuʼoan are arranged in a simple four-vowel system, with three cardinal vowels \*i \*a \*u plus the schwa \*e, each of which has both a short and a long form.

|       | -   | Front   | Central | Back    |
| ----- | --- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Close | -   | \*i \*ī |         | \*u \*ū |
| Mid   | -   |         | \*e \*ē |         |
| Open  | -   |         | \*a \*ā |         |

### Diphthongs
Proto-Udovuʼoan is also reconstructed to have had a highly symmetric system of diphthongs composed of the same vowel qualities as the monophthongs.

|      | -   | Front opening | Front closing | Back opening | Back closing |
| ---- | --- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Mid  | -   | \*ie \*iē     | \*ei \*ēi     | \*ue (\*uē?) | \*eu \*ēu    |
| Open | -   | \*ia \*iā     | \*ai \*āi     | \*ua (\*uā?) | \*au \*āu    |

Long back opening diphthongs \*uē and \*uā are expected to occur due to the high degree of symmetry in the vowel system, but are conspicuously not found in any reconstructed terms.
