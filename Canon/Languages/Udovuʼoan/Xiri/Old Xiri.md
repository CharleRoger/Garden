**Old Xiri** is the oldest language in [[Udovuʼo]] to be attested in writing, having survived through scant inscriptions in the [[Ugugo#Origin and evolution|Savamāric Ugugo]] abjad from around the [[8th century BGS|8th]] to the [[3rd century BGS|3rd]] centuries BGS. It is closely related to the [[Proto-Xiri language]], the reconstructed common ancestor of all [[Xiri]] varieties, but exhibits some peculiarities which can be hard to explain and is likely not an ancestor of later [[Xiri|Standard Xiri]].

Some Old Xiri inscriptions demonstrate regional variation in the form of certain words, suggesting that the small corpus might represent a dialect cluster or group of closely related languages rather than a single narrow variety. Nonetheless, the orthography is otherwise quite uniform and Old Xiri is usually considered as essentially one language.

# Phonology

## Consonants

|             | -   | Labial | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Uvular | Glottal |
| ----------- | --- | ------ | -------- | ------- | ----- | ------ | ------- |
| Nasal       | -   | m      | n        | (/ɲ/?)  | ń /ŋ/ |        |         |
| Plosive     | -   | p      | t        | c /tʃ/  | k     | q      | ʼ /ʔ/   |
| Fricative   | -   | f      | s        |         |       |        | h       |
| Approximant | -   | w      | l        | y /j/   |       |        |         |

The presumed consonant inventory implied by the abjad orthography is a close match to the hypothetical reconstructed inventory of [[Proto-Xiri language|Proto-Xiri]]. One notable difference is the lack of a letter for the palatal nasal /ɲ/, which if it did exist in Old Xiri, was written simply as ⟨N⟩ or sometimes as the sequence ⟨N-Y⟩.

## Vowels
The vowels of Old Xiri are not definitely known since it was written with an abjad which did not record vowels, and not enough inscriptions have survived to be able to reconstruct the vowel system with any degree of certainty. It is thought that Old Xiri had an archaic vowel system which retained certain features of [[Proto-Udovuʼoan language|Proto-Udovuʼoan]] not found in [[Proto-Xiri language|Proto-Xiri]] and all descendant [[Xiri]] varieties.

Beginning in the [[3rd century BGS]], late in the history of Old Xiri or more strictly a transitional period between Old Xiri and [[Xiri|Standard Xiri]], a relatively narrow variety of vowel-marking systems emerged. The earliest of such systems are scantly attested and used only three vowel marks:
- **a** — Either the consonant was left unmarked or, sometimes, one end of a stroke of the base glyph was extended to emphasise that this was the basic unmarked form.
- **i** — An extra stroke was added, usually horizontal and often at the top or through the middle of the glyph, though there was a good deal of variation even in the early systems.
- **u** — A long vertical stroke was added, usually on the left of the glyph.

This orthography can be interpreted in a number of ways. Perhaps the most straightforward is that Old Xiri only had three vowel qualities, /i a u/, though it may be more likely that Old Xiri had a similar vowel system to [[Xiri|Standard Xiri]] and most of the other [[Xiri]] varieties, that is a five vowel system with contrastive length, in which the vowel pairs /e~i/ and /o~u/ would simply not have been distinguished in writing. Another possible view is that the vowels corresponding to [[Xiri|Standard Xiri]] mid vowels /e o/ were still expressed with the ancestral diphthong qualities with which they are reconstructed in the [[Proto-Udovuʼoan language]], with /ai au/ written the same as /i u/ due to their identical final component.

An additional complication is that certain instances of a vowel generally corresponding to [[Xiri|Standard Xiri]] /e/ were variously written with the vowel marks which ordinarily indicated /i/ or /u/. In [[Proto-Udovuʼoan language|Proto-Udovuʼoan]], this is reconstructed as a schwa, typically labelled \*e, and its rendering with early vowel marks may indicate that it had shifted to a close quality [ɨ] by that time, though this picture is muddied by the emergence of [[Xiri]] proper as a literary standard not long after the appearance of vowel marking.

Given the above, the two most likely sets of vowels for Old Xiri are believed to be /i ɨ u ai a au/ and /i ə u e a o/, with short and long vowels for all. This may represent the most significant divergence from [[Proto-Xiri language|Proto-Xiri]], which itself is reconstructed with a simple five-vowel system, again with a length distinction, as is common amongst later forms of [[Xiri]].
