**Old Xiri** is the oldest language in [[Udovuʼo]] to be attested in writing, having survived through scant inscriptions in the [[Ugugo#Origin and evolution|Savamāric Ugugo]] abjad from around the [[8th century BGS|8th]] to the [[3rd century BGS|3rd]] centuries BGS. It is closely related to [[Proto-Xiri language|Proto-Xiri]], the reconstructed common ancestor of all [[Xiri]] varieties, but exhibits some peculiarities which can be hard to explain.

Some Old Xiri inscriptions demonstrate regional variation in the form of certain words, suggesting that the small corpus might represent a dialect cluster or group of closely related languages rather than a single narrow variety. Nonetheless, the orthography is otherwise quite uniform and Old Xiri is usually considered as essentially one language.

# Phonology

## Consonants

|             | -   | Labial | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Uvular | Glottal |
| ----------- | --- | ------ | -------- | ------- | ----- | ------ | ------- |
| Nasal       | -   | m      | n        | (/ɲ/?)  | ń /ŋ/ |        |         |
| Plosive     | -   | p      | t        | c /tʃ/  | k     | q      | ʼ /ʔ/   |
| Fricative   | -   | f      | s        |         |       |        | h       |
| Approximant | -   | w      | l        | y /j/   |       |        |         |

The presumed consonant inventory implied by the abjad orthography is a close match to the hypothetical reconstructed inventory of [[Proto-Xiri language|Proto-Xiri]], the common ancestor of all [[Xiri]] varieties. One notable difference is the lack of a letter for the palatal nasal /ɲ/, which if it did exist in Old Xiri, was written simply as ⟨N⟩ or sometimes as the sequence ⟨N-Y⟩.

## Vowels

Though Old Xiri was written with an abjad which did not record vowels, it is assumed to have had the same vowel system as standard [[Xiri]] and most of the other [[Xiri]] varieties, that is a five vowel system with contrastive length, again identical to [[Proto-Xiri language|Proto-Xiri]].

|       | -   | Front | Central | Back |
| ----- | --- | ----- | ------- | ---- |
| Close | -   | i ī   |         | u ū  |
| Mid   | -   | e ē   |         | o ō  |
| Open  | -   |       | a ā     |      |
