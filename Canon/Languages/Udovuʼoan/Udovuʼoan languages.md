The **Udovuʼoan languages** constitute one of the world's primary language families. They are native to the islands of [[Udovuʼo]].

The reconstructed hypothetical ancestor of the Udovuʼoan languages is [[Proto-Udovuʼoan language|Proto-Udovuʼoan]], which is very similar in character to [[Old Xiri]], which is attested in writing.
