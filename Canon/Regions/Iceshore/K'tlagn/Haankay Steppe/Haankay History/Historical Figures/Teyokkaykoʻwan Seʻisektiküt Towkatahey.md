**Teyokkaykoʻwan Seʻisektiküt Towkatahey** `[t͡seˈjok.kai̯.koʔ.wɑn‿se.ʔiˈsek.t͡ʃi.cyt͡s ˈt͡sou̯.ka.t͡sa.xei̯]`, born **Koʻwan Seʻisektiküt Tiinayay** `[ˈkoʔ.wɑn‿se.ʔiˈsek.t͡ʃi.cyt͡s t͡ʃiː.na.jai̯]`, also known as **Koʻwan Seʻisektiküt Towkatahey Teyokkayʻoʻï** `[ˈkoʔ.wɑn‿se.ʔiˈsek.t͡ʃi.cyt͡s ˈt͡sou̯.ka.t͡sa.xei̯ t͡seˈjok.kai̯.ʔo.ʔɯ]`, also called **Seʻisektiküt Towkatahey Teyokkayʻoʻï** `[se.ʔiˈsek.t͡ʃi.cyt͡s ˈt͡sou̯.ka.t͡sa.xei̯ t͡seˈjok.kai̯.ʔo.ʔɯ]` or **Koʻwan Towkatahey Teyokkayʻoʻï** `[ˈkoʔ.wɑn‿ˈt͡sou̯.ka.t͡sa.xei̯ t͡seˈjok.kai̯.ʔo.ʔɯ]`, or simply **Hum Teyokkayʻoʻï** `[xun‿t͡seˈjok.kai̯.ʔo.ʔɯ]`, was the ruler of the first full coalition of the [[The Haankaysiw People|Haankaysiw]] simply known as the First Sun Empire or the [[First Sun Chiefdom]].

Her [[Names in Haankaysiw Culture||name]] breaks down as so: She is the daughter of _Sektiküt_ who's name means "Strong-Fox", so _Seʻisektiküt_ means "Child of Strong-Fox". She comes from the _Koʻwan_ clan, which derives it's name from The Mountaincradles, breaking down into _Koʻ_ which means "mountain, cliff, steep hill" and _Wan_ which means "crater, bowl"; The Koʻwan is called as such because it is the clan which resides the closest to the Mountaincradles - _Teyokkaykoʻwan_ means "Koʻwan-chief". Her child name comes from the Haankaysiw adjective for "nice, kind, charitable, virtuous", _Tiinay_. Her name itself, _Towkatahey_, means "Iron Fire" or "Iron Light" and she chose it due to her desire to unite the Haankaysiw people under one chieftain and the connection between fire and light and the (mythical) first Haankaysiw chieftan. Her title, _Teyokkayʻoʻï_, means Sun-Chieftan and is another reference to how the Haankaysiw believe that the first Haankaysiw chief that all Haankaysiw chiefs descend from or at least who all Haankaysiw chiefs can trace some of their inherited Ihös to.
