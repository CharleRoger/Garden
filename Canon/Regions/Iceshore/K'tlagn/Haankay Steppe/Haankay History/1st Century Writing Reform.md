Within [[1st century|a lifetime of the game start]], [[Teyokkaykoʻwan Seʻisektiküt Towkatahey]], who knows of writing but does not know how, is brought a bound bone scroll written by a shamanistic individual speaking a fringe dialect near the Mÿrzoto's mountains as she wants to learn more about the writing. After being informed how the writing works, and what one can write on, she decides that it can be made better, and requests the brightest minds she has access to create a more accessible script that fits Hüm Kiinfe better.

Reformed Haankaysiw Writing is written with brush and ink on parchment made out of hunted and herded animal hide. It is written top to bottom left to right with no punctuation and no logographs or images, at least not standardly. Towkatahey made sure that people can read and write this language by using the communal learning tendencies of [[The Haankaysiw People|her culture]]. Despite [[First Sun Chiefdom|her empire]] not lasting beyond herself, her impact on literacy and writing will be felt for a long time to come.

Harmonization is written with a diagonal line diacritic that starts at the right and goes down to the left; this diacritic is usually placed near the middle bottom of the glyph but can appear anywhere on the glyph. Coda morae are written with a horizontal line diacritic underneath glyphs that have the vowel /e/, as the dialect the Chief spoke had that vowel as a schwa in certain environments, and perhaps even elided in certain environments of her idiolect.
