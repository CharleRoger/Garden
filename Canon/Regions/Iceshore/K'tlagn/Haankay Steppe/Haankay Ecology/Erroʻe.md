The erroʻe `(Hüm Kiinfe /ˈer.ro.ʔe/ [ˈer.ro.ʔe])` is a species of long-haired bipedal ungulate native to the [[Haankay Steppe]] in [[K'tlagn]]. It is likely related to the bipedal ungulates of [[T'ugü]]. They are nomadic grazers and travel in herds, feature low sexual dimorphism, and have long shaggy hair with a dense woolly undercoat which may form a long "skirt".

Erroʻe on average stand about 1.2 to 2.2m tall at the shoulder, with a head and body length of 2 to 3.5m. Females tend to average to the lower end, while males tend to average on the higher end, but the ranges are the same for both sexes. They are well adapted to the Haankay Steppe and to the steeper slopes and cliff faces around it. The horns of the erroʻe extend outward before curving up and inwards, with each horn being about 60 to 75cm long. On average, the horns of males point forward up to a 60 degree angle to the muzzle, and the horns of the females point skyward.

Some [[The Haankaysiw People|Haankaysiw]] keep Erroʻe in their pastoral flocks, primarily this occurs in mefmoʻï that tend to stay in areas near steep slopes, cliffs, and mountainsides, such as those living near the edges of the steppe. Erroʻe are used for their fibre coats, milk, meat, and horns by the Haankaysiw that keep them. The horns of erroʻe are valued due to their ability to be used as a low register instrument, especially as one that can be used in certain Haankaysiw ceremonies.
