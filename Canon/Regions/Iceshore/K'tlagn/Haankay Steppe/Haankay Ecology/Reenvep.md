The Reenvep tree `(Hüm Kiinfe /ˈreːn.βep/ [ˈreːm.βep])`, also called the Reenvep Mulberry, or the Haankay Mulberry (Earth-style science name `Morus haankayensis`) is a species of flowering deciduous tree found around rivers, lakes, and streams in and around the [[Haankay Steppe]] of [[K'tlagn]]. The perennial woody tree grows to between 8 and 12 meters in height with leaves growing 4-15cm in length and 4-10cm in width. It produces and edible syncarp fruit 1-3cm long with a 0.75-1cm diameter, composed of a cluster of several smaller drupes similar to that of earthen mulberry trees and are a dull red to black in colour.

The [[The Haankaysiw People|Haankaysiw]] use this tree for a multitude of purposes: the wood is a viable core material for their recurved composite bows, the leaves are able to be steeped as a tea, and the fruits are edible and tasty to humans.

The Reenvep tree spreads its seeds through the migratory birds, primarily the blue-feathered [[Uunko]] cranes.
