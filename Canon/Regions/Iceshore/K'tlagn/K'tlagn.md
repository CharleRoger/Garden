K'tlagn is the edge of a continent, the deep pit of a rift valley dragging down into the sea. Made dry by the warm current along its coast and the rain shadow of its mountainous rim outside of the northern peninsula the land is dominated by wide steppe and cold desert, raised Mediterranean plateaus and along the coastal ridge of the islands and mainland before the basin, subarctic weather stretches down from the north west edge and forests fill the enclosed peninsula.

The island chain off the coast has an area of 242,059km² making it 9/10s of the New Zealand islands or about 0.9% of an Africa, the main island is no considered part of this chain because of the geological hotspot on the island giving it its own basin in the southern half and having grown the island over another covering an area of 226,843km², 9/10s of Romania or or 0.7% of an Africa. the mainland of the basin covers a much larger area of 4,290,377km² similar in size to the great Mongol state at the time of Genghis Khan's death, or 12% of an Africa

>*The ecology of the steppe is similar to the Patagonian grasslands in the south of Argentina and Chile, the grass is tall and flowers bloom in the fields during the spring, thickets of shrubs and small trees form along the run off from hills and dry in the hot summers, and swamp forests creep in where the mountains brake and the wet air can flow in and along the coastal islands. Many small grazing animals make their home here including a set of flightless song birds and small rabbit or chinchilla like herd animals, several kinds of foxes and weasels as well some seals in the major rivers and along the coast. Larger animals have been introduced with human settlement, such as horses and sheep. But the great birds, pockets of crocodilians, and other large predators prevent them from destroying the balance of the ecosystem*
