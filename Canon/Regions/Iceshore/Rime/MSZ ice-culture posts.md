**advice for foxlings** (a speech given in r₂lła₂) it will be spring soon and you will be grown foxes. there is advice that every fox knows and follows. when you learn this advice, you will know every fox alive, partly, and they will know you too, partly. if you do not follow this advice, you will not be known, and you will not know yourself. this advice is made of the experiences of your ancestors. by knowing it, you know your ancestors, too. they knew less advice than you will, because they only knew the advice of their own ancestors. they added their experiences, so that you will know them too, and know their experience. when you pass this advice on, you will add your important experiences to it, and then all of your descendants will know you, too. i will tell you this advice every day until open water first appears on the sea. you won't die. you won't be sad that you can die. your important parts aren't unique. they will come back to the world in other foxes. they will have more experience than you do. you will be sad when other people die, as much as you want. their parts won't come back to the world while you live. you will make your den's openings face perpendicular to the wind. you will live where there are lemmings. if you do not catch a lemming one season, you will move somewhere else, and catch a lemming in the next season. you will only start fights with people you don't know or don't like. you will only start fights over food. you will only start fights you will win. you will start fights. you won't kill foxes. they won't kill you either. they also know this advice. if you and a sibling live in the same den for a summer, you will live in different dens in the winter. you won't build your den in the sand next to a river. you won't tear down dens you didn't build.

 **courting a lkoa₂** (the thoughts and actions of a verbal fox in love) _i am happy here in this new den. today someone brought me part of a bird carcass, and it made me feel very loved. they are a thoughtful person and being around them makes me feel safer. i always feel better when i can smell them. i think i want to always be near them when they aren't busy._ (the fox thinks for a bit.) _maybe if they know how much i love them then they will let me do that. i love them very very much, though, and i don't know how they could find out that much love. i could dig a room and let them have it, but that doesn't feel like enough._ (the fox thinks a bit more.) _maybe i can tell them with words. i don't know if words can do that, though. i guess i should try anyway._ (the fox spends the rest of the morning thinking of what to say. then, they go up to their crush, and say:) "i like being in a den better than being outside a den because in a den i am safe and warm. but when i think about you i only feel safe and warm if i am with you, even if i am in a den. i will sleep very close to you and stay near you whenever i can. okay?" (the addressed fox stares for a bit, and then goes and lies down. the verbal fox goes and lies down as close to them as they can manage. eventually they fall asleep.) (edited)

**you are a lkoa₂** (the oral history of the lkoa₂) cw: self-harm, suicide, death it will be spring soon. you are probably thinking of moving out of the den now. there are things you should know before moving out of the den. these are things that happened to your ancestors. they are dead now, but the things still happened. they were very important to your ancestors, so they are probably very important to you too. if something very important happens to you, you can add it to the things. then it will have happened not just to you, but to all the lkoa₂. i will tell these things to you every day until you move out of the den. it is very long. but it is very important, so you will listen to it. things are made of their pasts. so are the lkoa₂. this is not only the past of the lkoa₂; this is them. and now it is you. you are a lkoa₂. you dug your den in a place that the rain floods, and your den washed away. you fought an owl for a lemming, and you won, and one of your eyes became blind forever. you found someone you always want to be near. you thought you would die of not eating, and you caught a slow-moving salmon. it snowed very very much, and you spent a very very long time digging your way out of your den, and you got very very hungry, and you caught a lemming on the snowy ground. you visited a den, and you said something wrong, and someone chased you out of the den. you saw a foxling playing, and you decided you will put more effort into hunting, and give the extra food to the foxlings. you fought a mink, and you died. a human cornered the person you always want to be near, and took them away forever. you dug your den in sandy ground, and it collapsed in the winter, and you dug your den in silty ground, and it collapsed in the summer, and you dug your den in sandy and silty ground, and it never collapsed. you visited a den, and you liked the patterns that somebody had scratched into the wall, and you scratched more patterns you liked in all your dens forever.
you dug where a river dried up, and you found flea sand, and you buried it, and you were sick for three days, and you died. a human cornered you and showed you their teeth, and you told them you weren't afraid, and they said something you didn't understand, and you followed them, and they gave you food, and later you decided you always want to be near that human. you felt scared, and you bit your foreleg, and your foreleg bled, and your foreleg became number and slower forever. you heard the person you always want to be near whine loudly, and you made the same whine, and you liked the sound very much, and you kept trying to find the whining sound that you liked the most forever. you dug your den in the sandy and silty ground below a tree, and it rained, and the tree fell over, and your den collapsed. you caught summer lemmings and buried them in the permafrost in your den, and they were fresh for a very long time. you and someone else started fighting a wolf, and you fled, and the other person died. you dug your den into the den of a red fox, and you and the red fox were both scared and ready to fight, and you didn't fight, and you brought the red fox food, and the red fox brought you food, and later you decided you always want to be near that red fox. it rained, and your neighbors' den collapsed, and they moved in with you. a polar bear caught seals every day for a winter, and you ate the seals together with the polar bear every day for that winter. you dug your den in silty ground with a lot of stones, and you built walls from the stones, and the den never collapsed. you put a piece of reindeer lichen inside your den in the spring, and it grew and carpeted a room. the person you always want to be near fought a wolf, and they died. you lost one of your foxlings in a snowstorm, and you wished you would get lost in a snowstorm. you smelled the ground unfreeze after a long winter, and you decided you like this smell more than any other smell.

**not liking talking disorder: a case study of neurodiversity in lkoa₂** i will now do the thing i hate where i say things about myself to feel better. i don't want to do this, but if i don't do it i will keep feeling bad. people seem to either talk or not talk. but i talk, but i want to not talk. i can't just choose not to, like other people… when i have feelings and ideas, they make me want to tell them to other people. it's like they are too big to fit in my mind. holding them in makes me feel like a den about to cave in. _the audience, a nonverbal denmate of the narrator, licks their nose attentively._ but when i talk, it feels very very wrong. i think the whole time that i should be quiet, that the words are hurting me and hurting others. each word is a thorny branch i am pushing out of the way, it is a footstep on sharp gravel. _the narrator pauses for a few minutes, to let the other fox reflect on their words, and to recover their own stamina._ when i meet new people i have to not let them find out that i talk. because when they find out, they will ask me things. and then i say i don't want to answer, and they will be upset. they will keep asking… "if you don't like talking, why do you do it? you can talk but you say you can't talk. i don't understand." and then i can't explain it, and they are upset. it feels like… it feels like talking is snow i can't shake out of my fur. like there is me, and my parts… and then there is talking, which is not a part of me. it is bad and i do not like it. _the narrator runs out of willpower and falls silent. the other fox licks their nose again and lies in place thoughtfully. later, for the rest of the narrator's stay at this den, most attempts at making conversation with the narrator would be interrupted by the other fox in some way._

## a lkoa mathematician gives a seminar on the state of the field
you will need to come inside so that i can show you the tail-patterns. hmm, you do not fit. i think maybe that small person over there does though. you will come with me, small person. i will show you the tail-patterns and then you will tell the large person about them.

the large person has a lot of objections to this idea, one being that the small person won't understand anything being said, but doesn't see the mathematician making any concessions, and prods the small person to follow the fox.

okay first i will show you the patterns talking about food. hmmmmm... no, i do not want to show you where the food is. i will show you the patterns talking about ground. here you are looking at the big ground pattern with the dens. it does not look like ground but it is. there are slashes that show places. they have rivery shapes between them. the different shapes show different amounts of ground. the straight shape says there's 128 tails between them... actually i will talk using strides, it says there's 32 strides between them. but it also has a slash in the middle of it, which says that there are actually 48 strides between them. this one has two slashes, which says there's 40 strides. this one has a slash and the slash has a slash, which says there's 56 strides. you see? you use a slash on something to add a half, and you use two slashes to add a quarter, and it flows that way.
there are other shapes to put between places. this shape is made of slashes all going in the same direction. it shows that there 16 strides or maybe less. we don't have a shape for less than 16 strides so we use this one. but if you add slashes to it then you know it says 16. this one is made of slashes that change direction. it shows that there are 64 strides. this one is made of direction-keeping slashes and also has a line through it. it says 128 strides. also this shape with the direction-changing slashes says 256 strides, but i only drew that to remember what that shape looks like. my ground pattern doesn't have any amounts that are that long. 
the pattern doesn't say which places the markers are but i know anyway. this is this den. this is the turn of the river. this is the den near the river. this is the further den near the river. this is the further shoreward turn of the river. this is the further landward turn of the river. you can see that the river turns are actually made of three direction-changing slashes. that's so that you can remember that those are river turns and not dens.
1.okay here i made another ground pattern. this is special because it is made of... i don't know the word for "hexagon" in your language. it is made of six-sided shapes. sometimes the shapes have less sides but it is best if they have six. this shows what kinds of ground there are between this den and the river. i only made some of this pattern; this was already here when i moved in. i think part talking about the river has about three generations of stories in it. you can see that the shapes get very small near the river, mostly three-sided ones. that is because the river changes its shape a lot and it changes the ground next to it. here the more slashes there are in the middle of the shape, the more times the river has flooded there. also there are these small scratches that say that there is sand there. it is obvious that there is sand near the river, but it is not obvious to everyone, and also sometimes there isn't sand. when there isn't sand it is the most dangerous to be there, because the river will carve away the ground and make more river. there are other patterns here that say what is in the ground. when it doesn't say sand, you... (_the mathematician tries to remember the word for "assume"._) you think that there's dirt. these horizontal slashes say how deep it goes. every new horizontal slash says about two, or maybe three, tails of depth. if you replace the slash with scratches then it means that there is sand at that depth instead. if you replace it with two crossed, slightly not horizontal slashes, then there are rocks there. if there is a big, messy scratch, then there is dirt or sand there, but there is so much stone or ice there that you can't dig. if there isn't anything then that's not part of the pattern and there's probably stone and you can't dig.
this is a very complicated pattern to remember but i think humans are good at remembering so you will remember this. i don't mind you telling the humans where the sand and stone is because it is important to know. i made most of the pattern by eating someone else fungus. the someone else fungus knows a lot about the ground because it lives there. i live above and below it but not in it. i guess for the someone else fungus the ground is like the air is to me. i don't know for sure because it's been a lot of time since i've eaten it. i think these kinds of patterns are very interesting and there are ways to find out roughly how much ground there is between any two connected places just from the amounts that are in the pattern, if you know enough of the amounts of the connections. i am still trying to figure out ways to do that with less and less knowledge, and more and more work. i don't think i will find all the best ways by the time i die so i'm using the patterns we use keep track of the food to write down the things i think of. but... _the fox lowers their ears somewhat, conflicted._ ...okay, i suppose i will show you where the food is and how i keep track of the amount of food. you won't tell the other people this! i am worried they will come in here and take the food. they would have to destroy the den and that would make me very very unhappy. will you not tell the other people about the food? _the small human wipes their hand on their face. the fox doesn't know what this means, but will take any excuse to talk about math._ okay, you will come with me.
_they head deeper into the den and lower into the ground. the part where the food is stored is right above the permafrost, and is comprised of a twisting, confusing labyrinth. the only light is from the surprisingly bright glow of the fungi that have grown in between the markings in the walls. the fox and the small person come to a fork. there is a draft from the direction they came._ these patterns say how much of each food there is. the food is in lots of places but the pattern is only here. these slashes here say the path to take. the left-tilted slash says… (_alła has words for wind-parallel and wind-perpendicular, but the small person's language doesn't._) along the wind, and the right-tilted slash says across the wind. the standing up slash says in between. you only have to choose between two things at each branch so this will tell you where to find the things. now this says what is at each place. i don't want everyone to know what's at the different places so i just marked them with... (_the fox doesn't know how to say "variable name" in the human's language, and opts to calque from the word they made up in alła, "mute scratches"._) i marked them with scratches that say nothing but are different anyway so i can tell them apart. i usually use these mute scratches when trying to think about ground amounts, but they are good to use here. these slashes say how much food there is in each place. one slash is enough food for a day. two slashes is enough food for 4 days. three slashes is enough food for 16 days. four slashes is enough food for a season. just like with the ground amounts, some of these are slashed to add a half. well, here the slash says to add twice a half, that is the amount that the slashes say. so this, the slashed slash, is 2, and this, the slashed-two-slashes, is 8. you can only make some numbers by putting other numbers next to them so that they are added together, but this is okay. i usually don't know exactly how long food will last anyway. (edited)
i will now show you one way to find out ground amounts on the big ground pattern. _the fox takes the small person back upstairs to an area with another set of charts, these ones shaped like various quadrilaterals, though mainly squares._ if you pick two places that aren't connected, but there are two places that connect to both of them and are also connected to each other, then you can do this: add up how much ground you go over when you go around all four places. then, you... you make a square with the sides having that amount, and you count how many strides fit inside that square, skipping every other count. then you turn the ground amount of the line connecting the two in-between places also into a square, and also count how many strides fit into that, but don't skip this time, count all the strides. take away that much from the amount from the first square. then try to make a square that fits that many strides inside it. the amount of ground covered by the lengths of a side of that square is roughly how much distance there is between the two points you wanted to find the distance between. i know other things you can do but i haven't made patterns explaining those yet. if you come back later i will have more patterns to show you. i really liked talking about this and i am happy now. but i am also tired and out of breath so you will go now. _the fox checks whether the area outside the den is safe (apart from the large and understandably scary person), and seeing that it is, shoos the small person out._

## what a random lkoa has to say about running water, throughout history

0:
some people to the west have this i think? they probably don't have very good drinking water there. i just drink out of the creek.

400:
people divert creeks into their dens? i've never heard of this. now i'm really excited to try it. i could eat so much fish…

800:
of course. we have it too. everyone i know has it. how would you stay clean without den creeks?

1200:
i don't think anyone has them now but some really old dens had them hundreds of years ago. weird features of dens are hard to keep functional for so long, but everyone writes down everything. writing is very easy to keep fresh. i mostly haven't read my den's writing. some of that writing might say how someone added a creek to it once.

## advice for foxlings (a speech given in r₂lła₂)
it will be spring soon and you will be grown foxes. there is advice that every fox knows and follows. when you learn this advice, you will know every fox alive, partly, and they will know you too, partly. if you do not follow this advice, you will not be known, and you will not know yourself.
this advice is made of the experiences of your ancestors. by knowing it, you know your ancestors, too. they knew less advice than you will, because they only knew the advice of their own ancestors. they added their experiences, so that you will know them too, and know their experience. when you pass this advice on, you will add your important experiences to it, and then all of your descendants will know you, too.
i will tell you this advice every day until open water first appears on the sea.

you won't die.
you won't be sad that you can die. your important parts aren't unique. they will come back to the world in other foxes. they will have more experience than you do.
you will be sad when other people die, as much as you want. their parts won't come back to the world while you live.
you will make your den's openings face perpendicular to the wind.
you will live where there are lemmings. if you do not catch a lemming one season, you will move somewhere else, and catch a lemming in the next season.
you will only start fights with people you don't know or don't like.
you will only start fights over food.
you will only start fights you will win.
you will start fights.
you won't kill foxes. they won't kill you either. they also know this advice.
if you and a sibling live in the same den for a summer, you will live in different dens in the winter.
you won't build your den in the sand next to a river.
you won't tear down dens you didn't build.

## courting a lkoa₂ (the thoughts and actions of a verbal fox in love)

*i am happy here in this new den. today someone brought me part of a bird carcass, and it made me feel very loved. they are a thoughtful person and being around them makes me feel safer. i always feel better when i can smell them. i think i want to always be near them when they aren't busy.*

(the fox thinks for a bit.)

*maybe if they know how much i love them then they will let me do that. i love them very very much, though, and i don't know how they could find out that much love. i could dig a room and let them have it, but that doesn't feel like enough.*

(the fox thinks a bit more.)

*maybe i can tell them with words. i don't know if words can do that, though. i guess i should try anyway.*

(the fox spends the rest of the morning thinking of what to say. then, they go up to their crush, and say:)

"i like being in a den better than being outside a den because in a den i am safe and warm. but when i think about you i only feel safe and warm if i am with you, even if i am in a den. i will sleep very close to you and stay near you whenever i can. okay?"

(the addressed fox stares for a bit, and then goes and lies down. the verbal fox goes and lies down as close to them as they can manage. eventually they fall asleep.)

## a scientist explains the state of nuclear energy research to a journalist, c. 1200 
okay so, you know how when you go hunting, you only catch the big lemmings, right? because the small ones are mostly made of bone and they run too fast. but also, because the small ones will go make more lemmings! and then they will get big and then you can eat them anyway. me and my friends figured out what the small lemmings do to make more lemmings and get big. they run around everywhere, eat a lot of food, have sex, and make more lemmings! like little foxes, but they catch moss and seeds, not lemmings. i'm not sure if they really run everywhere when we're not looking, though. maybe they're just scared of us. and it's pretty good, right? the lemmings figure out how to make more lemmings for us, and then we eat the lemmings. we just have to go catch lemmings sometimes. but: if we buried the lemmings in our dens so they couldn't get out, then they'd have to make all the small lemmings right there. all we would have to do is bring them food and find the lemmings other lemmings they want to have sex with. then they would make more lemmings, and then when we did it with those lemmings they would make even more lemmings, until you run out of room in your den and you have to move somewhere else. but you'd never be hungry again! nobody would be. everyone could just go to the den full of lemmings to eat. but it turns out finding lemming food is HARD. it's really hard! i bring them so many different seeds and mosses and they only eat a few, so next time i have to look for those kinds of seeds and mosses, but then i get really tired and can't bring the lemmings enough food. also my friends say lemming romance is really hard too. so i think maybe we can't live with lemmings in our dens. lemmings are a lot better at finding food for lemmings than foxes are, and they already know who they want to have sex with. so maybe we have to keep just letting all the small lemmings go when we hunt and let them grow into big lemmings on their own. me and my friends will keep trying to make lemmings live in dens but i don't think we'll figure it out. okay now imagine that the lemmings are fire that lives inside rocks.
