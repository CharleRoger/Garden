first attempt (both in- and out-of-universe) to adapt the haankaysiw writing system. this is all that the person who made this adaptation could finish before they died in a fight with an owl at age 6. produced circa 600 years after the start of the game. black is the inscription itself, red is the phonetic and (when relevant) semantic gloss of the inscription, and blue is a gloss of how it reads to someone who is familiar with the script it was adapted from.

second attempt in-universe to adapt the aforementioned writing system. this was started by someone who was bored during the winter and had a pretty good memory for the shapes of the original writing system. (the previous attempt was made by someone who was getting coached by someone native to the script.) this person lasted about half a winter before getting bored and frustrated and giving up. unlike the last person, they attempted to create their own glyphs for the missing consonants. (the cartography and art of the lkoa is usually very horizontal. they are inscribed in fungi and lichen on the short walls of the den, so there is not much vertical room. the previous attempt was done outside of a den, so there was more room.)
