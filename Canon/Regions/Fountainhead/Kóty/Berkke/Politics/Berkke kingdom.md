- During the 100BGS-0 various [[Berkke tribes]] dotted the landscape of [[Berkke land]], disunited each of them had their own leader, tenets and pantheon,they are: [[Asi]], [[Imbir]], [[Ylio]], [[Framy]], Om, [[Pušči]], [[Saļ]] and [[Efyry]]. Despite each tribe containing its own pantheon, each special occasion they commune to praise Bofaç god of war and Lōš god of fire cellebrating each with special rituals and ceremonies, war was sacred to them.
- Telehe empire expanding its power posed a threat to the existence of Berkke,  war was waged against invasions many Berkke won, but Telehe still was larger in force and much more united in combat. An assembly was called, both Telehe and Berkke discussed, they set upon a treaty, Telehe accepted. 
- Marriage alliances were cast as part of the reconciliation.  [[Amakke of Imbir]] daughter of [[Styč of Imbir]] desired by Emperor [[Šemedo]] sealed this treaty. An era of unity and peace proceeded, which lasted at least two generations. Writing, art, bureaucracy, philosophy and goods were shared between them. Trading across the land is also well established, it flourishes this time.
- Telehe influence becomes more apparent, this serves no good for Berkke, a common feeling that Telehe occupied the land replaces the expectations of partners in this relation. Telehe lords become tyrannical, demanding more tributes in times of need. Additionally Telehe promoted the construction of Temples and Coinage houses of foregoing gods, to which Berkke sought no use.
- Three rebellions against Telehe in a brief time of discontentment of Berkke party, led by Simi and Ȳmus. To which they are crushed by Telehe armies, and both leaders assassinated. The anti-Teleheist sentiment swept the nation once more.
- Defeated Berkke rebels lost hope in old gods, temples were closed, priests have fallen ill-minded, closed cults sought to console people and provide services for those injured by the Telehe, temples became infirmaries. 
- One prophet Ergoy, driven by his faith, preached Losh, inspired by the old supreme Lōš,  recontextualized as a god of labor, art, technology, innovation, community and unity embodied in three aspects: Truth, Fate and Judgement. The flame of faith and hope started and Ergoy fueled the people with hope and spirituality. The people treated it as the “new old god” in a way, a connection to the old gods through new lenses.
- Many wars proceeded after [[Ergoy]] sowed the seeds of hope in the people, he led many as a flock. Authority in Berkke lands became unstable, [[Qachkav]] and [[Tohaol]] warlords launched many attacks in the vulnerable cities and afterwards major settlements and Telehe forts. They were superficially loyal to the [[Telehe Emperor]], but fought amongst each other. Telehe didn’t have much choice other than to aid some factions for their own profit. The emperor just recognizes whoever responded well and was the most powerful eventually.
- Rule over Berkke lands became chaotic, fractioned, unstable and corrupt, Loshianists eventually spread across the  Telehe empire, their influence and revolutionary ideas, angry Telehe lords, resulting in persecuting these minority groups. 
- Warlords shortly took over, recognised by Telehe emperor as rightful rulers, lasting only very briefly, as [[Bērzun]] the head of [[Telehe Empire]] fell by the hands of [[Ħautar delûr|Ħautar]] and minority groups.
- Berkke warlords used Telehe lords as scapegoats for their troubled times, resulting in the betrayal of Telehe lords, many are kicked, killed, lynched and stranded astray. Desiring to establish order, warlords elected a king, it was the beginning of a new chapter in Berkke history.
- Steadily becoming normalized the sentiment of unity of Berkke people became a crucial aspect for the formation of the Berkke empire, surpassing the Telehe empire in size and power, managing to weather the storm even more. Essentially becoming the successor of Telehe empire.

The reign of [[Erojo]] is one of the most controversial of them all, he had the decision to rule out and ban introducing new cults of strange and divergent nature, including Loshians in which he most disliked. Loshians had secret temples, preferring the dark corner where no one could be seen except those with torches and in meeting saloons, often regarded as temples and ceremonial rooms. This sparked curiosity and backfired terribly since most traditional rituals were performed during the day and out in public, Loshians were humiliated and beaten for misbehaving in secret chambers and caves.

Once Erojo died, the Berkke kingdom was subsequently divided once more. It split into three other kingdoms. Each of them continued to forbid religious freedom.

[[Kingdom of Gannya]]: The most mountainous of the three, it is a diverse kingdom with the most distinctive Verkke-Geryo dialect of Berkke language. The majority of the population still adheres to Losh, but they are now in the minority because most Loshians fled into the wilderness and numerous abandoned Loshian temples were either demolished or used in novel methods by adherents of the traditional religion of Berkke.

  

[[Kingdom of Eleria]]:The most populous of the three kingdoms, it was once a Loshianist country but it had set up religious freedom under conventional Eleria. First most traditional of the three, Eleria, named just after the king, still authorized religious freedom.

  

[[Kingdom of Ogwal]]: The effects of Erojo couldn't be seen, but the fear of being dismantled caused many Loshians to flee in hopes of a better place on the shores of Kóty, to only endure the harsh climate and fruitless soil. Ogwal country wasn't persuaded, and it never served Erojo in his battle, releasing Ogwal country almost unchanged.

  

The kingdom of Ogwal and Gannya despite having their heritage set up, they united themselves in a marriage affair, but the gods once more cursed them Berkke folks, no male was born from this relation, a problem of succession stroke the both kingdoms that now desperate looking for a heir, years came by, no one was qualified enough,  

In 1123 AGS a heated discussion between the kingdom of Ogwal and Gannya in regards to the next heir of both kingdoms since they would , this event came to be known by both kingdoms, they send letters, for days this was considered an accident, until a false letter arriving the kingdom of Ogwal, making them believe it was meant to happen.

The next years were unhappy as several conflicts in between the kingdom of Ogwal and Gannya took place, allowing the Qachkav kingdoms to strengthen themselves and beat these two kingdoms.

# 1150-1200

In 1170 AGS the war against Loshianists worsened, they were put in giant stadiums and then killed like a theater play. Loshianists were forced to live in a diaspora, scattered around many regions, they grew fearful and isolated far away from their homeland. They settled in a distant island in [[Kóty]], inhabit at first but they endured. Missionaries and priests traveled to continental Kóty to spread [[Loshianism]]. 

Few kingdoms and nations adopted the Loshian religion and became a reference point for Loshians.
