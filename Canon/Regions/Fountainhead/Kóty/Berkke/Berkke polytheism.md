Berkke polytheism > Mystery cult of Losh (Old god of fire, blacksmiths) > Ergoy was a priest of this cult (together with 5 other priests and one priestess/oracle) > after Ergoy had the revelations, three out of the 6 priests decided to follow Ergoy including Brimys (his lover) > two of them later on developed their own interpretation of Losh while Brimys stayed faithful to Ergoy > Brimys became the guide of Loshianists to their journey (both Ergoy and Brimys were very loud in regards of this new faith, hence why the other two priests weren't so much attacked by Telehe Empire and others)
