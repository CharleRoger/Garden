**Ergoȳ** ([[Berkke language|Berkke]]: \[erɡo̯ɤː ~ erɡɤː\], [[Ansang language|Ansang]]: \[erŋo\]) was a [[8th century]] [[Berkke]] religious reformer who challenged the tenets of the contemporary [[Ancient Berkke religion]], becoming the spiritual founder of [[Loshianism]]. 
Ergoȳ preached devotion to **[[Lōš]]**, believed to be the one and all-powerful God, directly challenging the prevailing polytheistic beliefs and religious authorities of his time. Due to his fringe beliefs, Ergoy was exiled.
Within [[Loshianism]], Ergoȳ is honored as the first **[[Fuzyrhȳ]]**, meaning "mouth of God", a prophetic title given to those considered exceptionally influential and divinely inspired. 
Ergoy's teachings laid the basis for Loshianism, which went on to spread widely throughout the region of [[Berkke land]], [[Arklobu Islands]], and [[Ujȳr]].
## Name
A typical Berkke in Ergoy's time had only one name, usually followed by a patronymic. As for **Ergoȳ**, his name derives from the root *Erg-* 'To anoint', generating the meaning 'The anointed one'. 
Although little is known of his private life, it is said that Ergoy had a different birthname, to which he renounced as an act of devotion to **Lōš**.
