#ħautar_delûr 

In the traditional [[Ħautar delûr|Ħautaric]] system of rule, each town is ruled by a man known as ***kune ârcak*** (old lord sower), and a woman known as ***êne ârcak*** (old lady reaper). Collectively, they are called the *ârcacak*. The ârcacak are, as a rule, the oldest man and oldest woman in each town. At the point at which they come to power, they must forgo their previous partners and marry each other, and they rule jointly after this point. It is usual for such couples to last together only three or four years, because, when one dies, the other undergoes ritual suicide, usually by poison. The poison is "fed" to the deceased partner, and then the corpses are both decapitated.

The new ârcacak are inaugurated by the head *[[lâkçuf]]* of the town fifty-four days after the death of the previous ârcacak; during the intervening time they are not allowed to mingle with the rest of the populous, and cannot eat dairy products, but only vegetables (and on the inauguration day, goat-meat). The roles of the two ârcacak are in heavy symbolic duality, as suggested by their names. Political marriage is also common; unmarried descendants of reigning ârcacak are encouraged to marry each other, as long as they are not related within the boundary of incest. The broad [[Ħautar delûr|Ħautaric]] definition of incest means that *mdar-ârcacakek* (the children of the ârcacak) often marry outside their own towns.

# Bar-ârcacak

The terms *bar-ârcak* (high-ârcak) and *bar-ârcacak* were first coined in 266 AGS when [[Mteni II]] and [[Ra'iek I]] were wed, unifying the rule of [[Uṣûnur]], [[Leṣek-etku]] and [[Dâmer-ṭegik]] into the [[First God-Kingdom of the West]]. The terms continued to be used for the rulers of the [[New Kingdom of Dâmer-ṭegik]].

# Deviation from tradition

In the [[3rd century]], some of the north-east cities took not to decapitation of the bereaved, but to a mock decapitation, after which the former [[Ârcacak|ârcak]] is allowed to return to society (although forbidden from ever becoming [[Ârcacak|ârcak]] again). This was viewed with suspicion by the highly conservative [[Ħautar delûr]].
