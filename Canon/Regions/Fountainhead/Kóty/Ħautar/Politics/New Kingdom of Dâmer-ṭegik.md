The New Kingdom of Dâmer-ṭegik was a [[Ħautar delûr|Ħautaric]] absolute monarchy seated in the city of [[Dâmer-ṭegik]], which ruled over various cities from 354 AGS onwards, being briefly replaced by 
# History
The [[First God-Kingdom of the West]] left its mark on the western cities, particularly [[Dâmer-ṭegik]] and [[Leṣek-etku]]. When [[Dâmer-ṭegik]] declared independence in 354 AGS, they did so to install their own monarchy in order to self-rule. The noble families conspired to create their own line of succession, beginning with the marriage of [[Turen I]] to his wife [[Ralku I]]. While no man among the nobility could be proven to be related to [[Ra'iek I]], [[Ralku I|Ralku]] had a claim to the throne by way of being the great-granddaughter of [[Mteni II]] and the cousin of [[Mnubaiek I]]. The pair won the support of other families through promises of future marriages to their children from previous marriages.

Under the guise of liberating the western cities and restoring the Ħautaric tradition, a band of soldiers organised by the [[Dâmer-ṭegik]] nobility marched on [[Leṣek-etku]] in 358, invading and effectively destroying the home of the King and Queen, leaving their fate up to the people of the city. This was perhaps the only show of military force in [[Ħautar]] history thus far, but note that they did not conquer the city and [[Dâmer-ṭegik]] remained a singular free city without political connection to [[Leṣek-etku]]. [[Turen I|Turen]] and [[Ralku I|Ralku]] were wed in secret before the invasion even took place, but their ascendancy to the newly created [[Ârcacak#Bar-ârcacak|bar-ârcacak]] of the New Kingdom of Dâmer-ṭegik was publicly decreed shortly after. All kings and queens of the [[First God-Kingdom of the West]] were retroactively recognised as [[Ârcacak#Bar-ârcacak|bar-ârcacak]] [[Dâmer-ṭegik|Dâmer-ṭegikek]]*.

Succession followed a mixed system in which the king could come from any noble family, but the queen must be descended from [[Ralku I|Ralku I's]] mother (the oldest proven descendant of [[Mteni I]] who also happened to be called Mteni), and must herself already have children from a previous marriage. If either monarch died, the other would undergo the traditional suicide. The asymmetrical nature of this system meant that the first few queens of [[Dâmer-ṭegik]] were female-line descendants, and this quickly stuck as a rule.

Then followed a century of prosperity in the [[New Kingdom of Dâmer-ṭegik|new kingdom]], the first century in perhaps the city's entire history which saw no war whatsoever. Many smaller settlements became vassals of the kingdom, which was quickly outgrowing its status as a city state. As population, territory, and the economy grew, the throne of the kingdom grew ever more lucrative.

In 461 AGS, [[Lenre III|Lenrek mdari]] deposed the rulers of the new kingdom and declared himself [[Ârcacak#Bar-ârcacak|bar-ârcak]] of the [[Second God-Kingdom of the West]], which lasted until 469. After this brief attempt at a restoration and a subsequent five-year period of anarchy, the throne of Dâmer-ṭegik was restored by [[Mteni IV|Mteni IV's]] niece [[Mnubaiek II]] and her husband king [[Meṣṭet I]] in 474. The [[Telehe Empire]] was formed 489, and in the following centuries saw some conflict with Ħautaric rule, particularly the New Kingdom of Dâmer-ṭegik.
