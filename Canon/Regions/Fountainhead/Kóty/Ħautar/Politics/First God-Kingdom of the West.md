The First God-Kingdom of the West was a [[Ħautar delûr|Ħautaric]] absolute monarchy ruling the cities of [[Uṣûnur]], [[Leṣek-etku]] and [[Dâmer-ṭegik]], lasting from 265 to 358.

# History

In the far west of the [[Ħautar delûr|Ħautar]] lands, the rise of a succession of brothers and sisters in various cities around 265 caused [[Mteni I|Mteni getaxte-iluṭ]]- after her semi-sacrilegious (due to sharing the patronym *Ra'iek*) to [[Ra'iek I|Ra'iek mkuṣûnuṭ-'amtan]] to become the first *[[Ârcacak#Bar-ârcacak|bar-ârcacak]] [[Leṣek-etkuk]]* (High Queen of [[Leṣek-etku]]), effectively unifying within herself and her children the religious and political powers. This "God-Kingdom of the West", growing out of the three cities [[Uṣûnur]], [[Leṣek-etku]] and [[Dâmer-ṭegik]], and controlling both church and state within their realm, managed to make a second duality-system out of the shards of the old one. The woman (descended from [[Mteni I]]) symbolised life, power, mortality and humanity, while the man (descended from [[Ra'iek I]]) symbolised death, peace, immortality and divinity. From here on out, their territory would be ruled by a married couple descended from these two: their children from previous marriages would marry upon coming to the throne, after having married others themselves and having issue by whom to continue the line, thus avoiding breaking incest-taboos (which only dealt in spouses and blood-relatives). The age-rules were abandoned.

This system lasted until the rule of [[Mnubaiek I]] (a descendent of [[Mteni I]]) and [[Lenre II]] (a descendent of [[Ra'iek I]]), beginning in 353, under which the whole kingdom fell apart. [[Dâmer-ṭegik]] declared independence in 354 and elected its own [[Ârcacak]]. In 358, the Queen and the King were killed and the old [[Ħautar delûr|Ħautaric]] traditional system was reinstated.

When the [[Ħautar delûr]] eventually rejected the monarchy and fell back on traditional decentralised gerontocracies, some features of the hereditary succession they had known for the last century remained in these two cities. They had seen the greatest economic benefit from the God-Kingdom, producing a handful of affluent families with marital connections to the royalty in its short history. The new nobility saw great benefit in the hereditary succession system, not only for personal security, but longer reigns meant the potential for longer periods of social and economic stability. Smaller settlements also became slightly more centralised in the wake of the God-Kingdom, with many larger towns ruling over neighbouring settlements which had historically had their own [[Ârcacak]].

Once the uprising in [[Leṣek-etku]] settled, a new [[Ârcacak]] was installed by the marriage of two noble families. The selection of new [[Ârcacak]] of the two great cities continued to be restricted to the new nobility rather than the entire townspeople, but they were still typically the oldest people among them. Although hereditary succession was not encoded into the system, it was common for the [[Ârcacak]] to pass from sibling to sibling.
