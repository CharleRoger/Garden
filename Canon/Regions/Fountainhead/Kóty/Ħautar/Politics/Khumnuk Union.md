The **Khumnuk Union** was a union of [[Ħautar delûr|Ħautaric]] cities lasting from 766 to 1012 AGS. The cities within the union operated with a high degree of autonomy, while a special [[ârcacak]] held certain universal powers.
# History
Around 760 AGS, the [[ârcacak]] of the cities of [[Cerin]], [[Tulu-Mdari]] and [[C̣auhin]] were in dispute with fish-merchants over the rights to fish in certain parts of the nearby river and lake. In 761, the Khumnuk Alliance (*khumnuk* "lake") was formed out of the three cities, in order to regulate the use of fishing waters, among other economic matters. The city of [[Karhetaian]] joined shortly thereafter.

Despite this, dispute and corruption persisted. In 766 it was decided to install a new [[Ârcacak]] on one of the lake's islets to act as an impartial political entity which would govern the entire lake, with input from the other cities of course. On the vernal equinox of that year, by the marriage of a one Lantukê to Baṣ, the Khumnuk [[ârcacak]] was established on the newly named [[Bâcut Island]]. This new political arrangement was the Khumnuk Union, in which the Khumnuk [[ârcacak]] had special universal powers over the other cities benefiting from the use of the lake and its tributaries, but each city retained an [[ârcacak]] with highly devolved powers of their own. This system proved to be quite successful, attracting the cities of [[Lauhan-ṭegik]], [['Emrek-Etku]], and [[Mamdari]] to join the union over the next 16 years.
