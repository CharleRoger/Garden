The Second God-Kingdom of the West was a short lived attempt by [[Lenre III|Lenrek mdari]] to restore the [[First God-Kingdom of the West]], lasting from 461 to 469 AGS.
# History
In 461 AGS, the [[Ârcacak|ârcak]] of [[Leṣek-etku]] declared himself *[[Lenre III|Lenrek mdari]]* (offspring of Lenre), alleging he was the great-great-grandson of [[Mnubaiek I]] and [[Lenre II]]. This would be a more direct connection to recent rulers and twice the claim of the sitting king of [[Dâmer-ṭegik]], [[Turen III]]. If he were to take a wife descended from [[Mteni I]], they would have a greater claim to the assumed-dead [[First God-Kingdom of the West|God-Kingdom]] than any pair in history. [[Lenre III|Lenrek mdari]] murdered [[Turen III]], asserting that this was justified punishment for the crime of ruling while neither being descended from [[Ra'iek I]] nor being nearly the oldest man available for the role. [[Turen III]] was in fact the youngest [[Ħautar delûr|Ħautar]] ruler in history, ascending the throne at 41 (28 Earth years). [[Lenre III|Lenrek mdari]] reasoned that [[Turen III|Turen's]] wife [[Mteni IV]] was free of these charges and a victim of the pretender, so need not undergo the usual "suicide" in such exceptional circumstances. Of course, he then married her, setting a dangerous example which would lead to his death seven years later in 468 as his nephew [[Hiṣaṭ II]] did the exact same thing. [[Hiṣaṭ II|Hiṣaṭ]] was deposed by the [[Leṣek-etku]] priesthood the following year, [[Mteni IV]] volunteered for traditional suicide and the God-Kingdom was no more.

[[Hiṣaṭ-Yɨlomono theory|One popular and not unlikely theory]] suggests that [[Hiṣaṭ II]] was not in fact the nephew of [[Lenre III|Lenrek mdari]], but rather was the exiled [[Ansang Empire|Ansang]] king [[Yɨlomono]].
