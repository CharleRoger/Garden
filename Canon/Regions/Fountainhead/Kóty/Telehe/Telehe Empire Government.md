#Telehe_Empire #Kóty 
Telehe Empire government consisted of three institutions that together administrated the whole Empire.
## Ōle ilrasamer 'First council'
### Asay
The Emperor is the supreme person in charge of the empire, emperors are by default deified and thus must be worshipped by all people.
### Pnosehis
The augurs of the empire, they care about making divinations and provide good news or depending bad news; they operate using devices such as arrows, darts, smoking, fumes and also burning letters or bones with requests, inquires, questions or thanks to the gods.
### Dala ublahin
Three priests, they are the high priests I've talked about in an old post, they basically decide for the Emperor, when he is absent or hasn't risen up to the throne yet; each of them makes an oath to worship, celebrate and always wear the favorite color of their god, they are **Orim ublahis** priest of [[Orim]], color: yellow; **Lōš ublahis** priest of [[Lōš|Losh]], color: black  and **Cnūmnoi ublahis** priest of [[Cnumnoi]], color: blue.
## Circe ilrasamer 'Second council'
The second council is constituted by
### Sfā embacs 'Makers of coins'
They administrate the making of the currency the telehe empire uses, not only that they are the imperial scribes, they make report news and sent letters to other provinces of the empire.
### Tlefes
Important priests that carry out celebrations and take care of the populace religiously, these also control entire provinces and watch over the local temples, many of tlefes were sent to [[Ħautar delûr|Ħautar]] lands in the hopes to fully convert them, many were killed attempting to break into their mighty temples and so Hautkar banned tlefes from their lands. Characteristically dressing white and head covering themselves, easily to be spotted.
### Tlefērzē
Called small priests, these take the job to attend ill people and sometimes carry out the work to syncretize regional gods into the Telehe pantheon and restructure regional mythology to fit Telehe desires to worship the Emperor and Telehe pantheon. 
### Ōitrismerīs 'Militar leadership'
They are the war lords that recruit people and train them to become soldiers to fight and repel rebels in the empire's border (the military have their own pyramid of power this is just a oversimplication).
## Yavan ilrasamer 'Third council'
### Hilics embacs
These are the peace makers, they are a group of people that serve as puppet kings that are normally natives, so by extent all provinces had this kind of puppet king, the province of the Hautkar had detestable feeling towards them, but the elite massively supported them since they provided good payment for making 'peace' with the natives. Although it all came down when the Hautkar killed their peace maker and marched to Berzun to end the Telehe tyranny.
### Tmēcahis
Collector of taxes these make sure to count and stablish the taxation according to the wishes of the Tlefe.
### Gizis
The crowd, the people, the common populace subordinates to the Telehe empire. They are without honor and hardly can become anything other than soldiers to the empire, there's a few people that became Tlefes.
### Sōrpne
Slaves, these are people that have failed to comply to the laws and/or have not paid their taxes correctly, their service is only to build and keep cities clean from dust and trash, their work time varies from time to time, they don't have access to public spaces, their mouths must be kept shut until they've paid their debt.
