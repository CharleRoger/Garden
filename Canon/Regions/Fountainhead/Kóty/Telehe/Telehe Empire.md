# Proto-Telehe kingdom

[[Bērzun]] had existed a century before the Telehe Empire as it is transmitted to us by the records of that time, though not fully accurate they serve as a foundation to the history of this empire. A proto-telehe kingdom would likely be true as a step towards unity of the telehe speaking tribes in the Haracute “Heart of Kóty”.

Before the Empire, around the 300AGS the early concept of the word Telehe started to gain popularity as the name of a people that spoke the same dialect continuum and had similar traits, to that they become richer by assisting themselves in many aspects such as raiding other neighboring nations, the Early Ansang kingdom located in their isles were attacked by them around 340AGS, they successfully conquer land around the Leda river and form a confederation in 350AGS encompassing the city that would eventually be called Bērzun “Belly button”. The name [[Telehe people|Telehe]] was chosen as an ethnonym for those that spoke the [[Telehe language|language]] and worshiped their gods. The city of Bērzun was the center the confederation, were they would meet each time to discuss a major concern or activity within and outside their claims, but in the 500AGS a wealthy family of the most respected name Foičī, stood and pronounced in their tongue a deal of absolute ruleship under the name of the first born male of them parents, elevating Ērēdoy into the status of Asay Gērīr “King of all peoples”.

# Relations with other institutions

Despite the bitterness Telehe Empire framed itself, it had a few unpleasant neighbors that they had to befriend, otherwise war and disgrace would come certainly, the tribes up the [[Qachkav]] mountains were observed and left alone, tributes were paid to their tribesmen chiefs in return of no harm, they did that for the great amount of known struggles of other peoples around the [[Qachkav]] have faced in the past years, as the [[Qachkav]] folk know their ground and we do not.
Hautaric kingdoms were seen as the wrongdoers, they did not attempt assimilation but tried to enter their territory with their tongue, they were unsuccessful.
Berkke kingdoms were small in comparison, they paid tributes greatly and their people were considered Telehe in spirit but Berkke in shape.

[[Telehe State Religion]]
# Morning: Edorsi (0-500AGS)

- First Telehe folk split off [[Proto-Dreic]] (0AGS).
- City States span the entirety of the Yān Laēdē river including Bērzun, one of the most populated Telehe settlements (440AGS).
- Bērzun formed alliances with other cities, thus establishing a confederacy.
- They promptly invaded other neighboring cities and consequently invaded the Ansang that contained an essential part of the Laede river, they succeeded and Ansang did not hold any more claims to that land.
- Ērēdoy Asay Gēruiar the first Emperor, spoke on a council and made himself King of All Peoples. (500AGS).
- Another big factor for the formation of Telehe empire was, the construction and guard of trade routes throughout Kóty and Ansang islands, the desire to be a greater state and acquisition of resources and production and also a competition.
- Telehe language would begin to be written down in the Cisi logograph system by a brief contact in trade routes, Telehe simplified and invented the first alphabetic writing system in [[Kóty]] carved in stone and then into parchment.
# Afternoon: Mense (500-850AGS)

- Telehe empire expands, builds safe roads for trading, allowing efficient mobility and great expansion of the empire. It developed a writing system borrowed from the [[Cisi logograph]] that spread throughout the empire.
- Little expansions took place in some Ħautkar lands allowing the empire to impose their rules and traditions. Settlers in the newly founded Telehe Empire faced difficult times, tyranny was the common tongue spoken by the Emperor. (530AGS).
- As time went on, [[Bērzun]] didn’t explicitly had plans to oppress [[Ħautkar]] and [[Shote]], those that promptly rejected to pay tributes and build temples in their lands, the Emperor at that point judged them wrong and prohibited their own cultural identity to be practiced.
- This move wasn’t welcoming, [[Ħautkar]] and [[Shote]] lands were swept with Anti-Telehe-ist ideas, but nothing could be done; they were weak in the early centuries of the empire (550AGS).
- Šemedo Ēodinare rise to the throne, he then launched campaigns against Berkke Kingdom, three years later he decided to let Berkke decide for themselves, two years they had. (578AGS)
- In no time the emperor [[Šemedo]] Ēodinare formed a marriage bond with one the most rich families in the land of [[Berkke]], thus annexing Berkke kingdom, therefore tributes and total sovereignty of the land was given to the Emperor by his union with the lady [[Amakke]] Berkkun Hurut.(625AGS)

- The main branch of the [[Foičē family]] was brought to an end throughout the 756AGS; Tuntun, distant cousin of Saemedor was promptly indicated, he then rose to power and elevated his status. The empire had to deal with inflation and monetary decline throughout the 758AGS.

- Many believed that Tuntun's children weren’t his legitimate heirs, but Tuntun swore Umaso and his brother would perfectly fit as emperors. As tensions between Telehe and Berkke grew, unfounded suspicions of treachery and usurpation rocked Tuntun. As a result, many Berkke began to believe Telehe was flouting the succession laws. Telehe citizens were ruthlessly slaughtered during revolutions in the Berkke region.

- Ħautkar became more prosperous, that would haunt Telehe empire, they’re now much populous than any Kóty people, fear of losing its privileged position frightened Telehe empire, Maynda Oferay obsessed took drastic changes he takes a punitive campaign there, which fails, but for actually depleting the resources of the empire.  Inflation became the norm for these years and wealthy families enriched themselves independently by rising prices, many starved including Ħautkar in the exclaves, Maynda knew he was defeated and forced to withdraw, this would indicate Telehe empire’s end was coming, his mind crumbled together with his empire. Ħautkar attacked Bērzun in 850AGS, two weeks of bloodshed, Ħautkar officially destroyed the Telehe Empire’s capital. 


# Evening: Arzenle (850-1200AGS)

- The vacuum of power offered a great opportunity to the Ansang Empire to grow.
- Most of the Telehe remained assimilated into neighboring kingdoms and thus abandoned Telehe as their main language, but the writing stayed until 1000 before it began to change.
- The Telehe empire served as a model for later kingdoms because it was neither necessarily good nor bad but rather neutral in its own meanings. Because the Berkke kingdoms despised what the Telehe Empire had done to them, they made a great effort to comply with neither their laws nor their language. As a result, they established their own government, which had been created before the Telehe forcibly incorporated them into their empire through marriage affairs.
