The **Telehe Expedition of 839** was a punitive expedition against the [[Khumnuk Union]] commanded by the last [[Telehe Empire|Telehe emperor]] [[Maynda Oferay]].

# Background

In 839, [[Maynda Oferay]] finally took notice of the undue prosperity of the [[Ħautar delûr|Ħautaric]] states and dispatched a punitive expedition. He avoided an attack on the [[New Kingdom of Dâmer-ṭegik]] which would almost certainly have failed immediately, and instead targeted the more distant [[Khumnuk Union]]. Incredibly, a hodge-podge of local enforcers and private militias beat out the competition in a series of long-fought battles at [[Lauhan-ṭegik]]. After having expended the last scraps of the empire's rapidly draining treasury, [[Maynda Oferay]] ordered the retreat of any surviving soldiers, but they were captured at [[Xutuiar Uṣûnur]], beginning the [[Xutuiar Crisis]].
