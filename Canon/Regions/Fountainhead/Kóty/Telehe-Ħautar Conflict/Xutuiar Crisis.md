The **Xutuiar Crisis** (840 - 842 AGS) was a series of pivotal events in the [[Telehe-Ħautar Conflict]] which ultimately led to [[Ħautar invasion]] of 847 - 850.

# Background

In 839 AGS, the [[Telehe Empire|Telehe emperor]] [[Maynda Oferay]] had sent a [[839 Telehe Expedition|punitive expedition]] against the [[Khumnuk Union]], which failed after months of fighting. The survivors of the expedition were ordered to retreat back to imperial territory, but were captured by local enforcers at the city of [[Xutuiar Crisis]].

# Events

## Capture of the Telehe expedition

The weary band of militants retreating from the failed [[839 Telehe Expedition]] was captured at [[Xutuiar Uṣûnur]] in 840, where they immediately gave up arms and sought asylum as refugees. This began the Xutuiar Crisis, during which the soldiers were kept imprisoned and it was assumed that the [[Telehe Empire]] was about to launch an all-out war at the city in response. Months turned into years and it started to look like war was not coming.

## Formation of the Degâmun guard

In 842, the [[ârcacak]] of [[Xutuiar Uṣûnur]], anticipating the imminent collapse of the [[Telehe Empire]], released their captives and granted their asylum. With a massive pay rise, they subsequently formed the [[Degâmun Guard]], taking an oath to protect the city from the empire.
