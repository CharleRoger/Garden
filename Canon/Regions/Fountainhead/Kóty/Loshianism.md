## History

- Founded in [720](https://winter.miraheze.org/wiki/8th_century "8th century"), Ergoy received a vision of **Lōš** the ancient fire god of [Berkke tradition](https://winter.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Berkke_tradition&action=edit&redlink=1 "Berkke tradition (page does not exist)"), from there on Ergoy started teaching and composed four books, later compiled into the [Isçamalirǰeǰ](https://winter.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Is%C3%A7amalir%C7%B0e%C7%B0&action=edit&redlink=1 "Isçamalirǰeǰ (page does not exist)") _Morning-Noon-Night_ the sacred book of all Loshians.
- In 723 Ergoy have had more visions about the current times and about the end-times.
- In [729](https://winter.miraheze.org/wiki/8th_century "8th century") Ergoy built the first Loshian temple in [Redeye](https://winter.miraheze.org/wiki/Redeye "Redeye"), people that were drawn to it became the first Loshians.
- In 778AGS Ergoy was persecuted and almost killed by people that opposed his teachings, he was persecuted and ostracized together with the newly Loshian converts.
- Ergoy died in the first month of 781, in his death bed he ordained his most devout follower [Famfuir Eç](https://winter.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Famfuir_E%C3%A7&action=edit&redlink=1 "Famfuir Eç (page does not exist)") to compile Ergoy writings and manuscripts into a single book that all shall know by the mouth of yours.
- From 780~782AGS Loshianism had become a widespread religion, Ergoy had enough money to buy a great place, more than one hundred people gathered together every end of the day to hear Ergoy and his ideas, most of these were new to the faith and were interested.
- The influence of Loshianism in Telehe regions wasn’t welcoming, many loshian groups fought the telehe to not be assimilated into their polytheistic faith.
- Traditional authorities and the priests of Traditional Berkke religion thought about their religion coming to an end due to potential growth of  Loshianism, they conducted heavy changes to their religion including equal rights to women and other drastic changes, after that many people returned but the temples once got empty, they knew the enemy was clever, the king rapidly became aware of this and conducted incursions againsts those who believed in any form of Loshianism, after 2 years of fight Loshianists won the battle, after that they decided to lead a revolution against the king, many attempts were made, the king needed to do something, he openly gave 30% of all traditional temples to the new Loshianists, but they’d need to pay higher taxes directly to traditional priests and temples.
- In 850 with the fall of Telehe empire the district of Berkke once free of Telehe commands, they now would rule like kings again, the Hautkar incursion that destroyed Berzun.
- After that Berkke people gained more authority, at the same time a shift of religions happened, while countryside maintained the polytheistic tradition, even the king would be converted, from there one could affirm Berkke kingdom were at most 70% Loshianists.
- The first big temple dedicated to the Losh religion would be built in 923AGS, finally Loshianists had a place where they could feel safe.  
    - The temple was a mix of Traditional Temples and new architecture methods, the temple was built under the first place Ergoy used to live and established the religion, Ergoy died many years ago, his body was buried under the temple.
- In 1000AGS Berkke kingdom was mainly Loshianist, majority of Traditional people migrated outside the kingdom to build their own nation, a group of five hundred people including several priests and people who felt disgusted by Loshianism, they migrated into Qachkav land and even north into Krobu lands, from there many small states devoted to the old Berkke Gods established themselves.
    - At this point the priests have gathered together and decided to reform their religion so they could integrate more and more people, for this the cult of feminine deities was adopted before that feminine deities weren’t worshiped by everyone, a system of casts were created and a canonical text called Hōčīė Lāurin \[xo̞ːˈc͡çɪːɤ ɫɐːɯ̯ɾin] “The path of the Gods” it was used by all Traditional people, they coined the name Kėri Gaū Lāurin “The people of one hundred Gods”.

The common knowledge, and described in the [Losh Yeremen](https://winter.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Losh_Yeremen&action=edit&redlink=1 "Losh Yeremen (page does not exist)") is, the world was created when Losh blew out of his lungs the primordial waters and from that he pushed the sun, the two moons and Koty itself from the waters, from there, Koty was full of sludge and algae, all burning in the sun, because it did not moved, it was static, Losh then made it so, the sun and moons would always move in the sky.

Afterlife in Loshianism is said to be simply a path you go when you die, if you practiced good deeds when you was alive, Losh spirits would judge you and send you to either the [Joçepteyu](https://winter.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Jo%C3%A7epteyu&action=edit&redlink=1 "Joçepteyu (page does not exist)") "eternal joy" or [Goroed](https://winter.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Goroed&action=edit&redlink=1 "Goroed (page does not exist)") "Hole".
