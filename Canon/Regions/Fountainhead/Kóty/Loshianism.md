**Loshianism** is a monotheistic religion founded in the year 720, its adherents, the Loshianists, center their lives around the [[Isçamalirǰeǰ]] and the teachings of [[Ergoy]].
Loshianists believe the world was plagued with falsehood and false idols, Ergoy was given the task to cleanse the world and teach every people the truth that was given to him the night he received visions from Losh.
Loshianism originated in [[Stamnar-Lōššī]] about 720 AGS. Loshianists believe this is when Ergoy began receiving revelations, and when the flame of truth was given to him. By the time of his death Ergoy passed the flame of truth to his most trusted disciple and friend [[Brimys]]. 
## Beliefs

Loshianism lifestyle
Loshianists believe in three kinds of live someone can live up to:
* Sinful life, a life full of sins, murder, and idol worshippers.
* Miserable life, a life defined by neutrality, you may as well commit sins but be aware of them and rectify yourself by either asking for cleansing at a temple or praying for Losh's mercy.
* Holy life, a life defined by abandoning mortal desires and being together with Losh in a holy arrangement.


SECTS

The coming of a king
This sect developed from communities enslaved or that suffered, this sect is much centred in the idea that Losh one day will send a saviour or rather a king (no gender distinction) that will lead them to freedom and bring their glory back, it is an evenly unlikely to happen or just another empty prophesy many say, but even more people believe in this, just looking forward to a better future of shinny and glorious victory.

Others sects of Loshianism
From the other sects of the Loshianism faith, each one had its own variant of symbol. Each one had its own symbolism and meaning.
Borolu Loš Wrath of Losh
It is much more dim in terms of colours, sticking to a much darker one, they are much more reserved and secretive than the others, the little circles in between the star are to represent this.
Akaǰinlu kwatso Sons of Mercy
A sect much more focused on expanding, and integrating others communities, preach the word of Losh and increase their followers, that's what's the borders around the start are supposed to represent.
Aseylu gwaptod Coming of a king
This one is to represent their await for the the king that one day will come, sent by Losh itself, the beams going outwards and towards the ground are to symbolize this.


## Evil
Evil is not created, its fabricated by selfishly means, humans have fabricated evil by being selfish, envy and cruel to each other to which only Losh can point humanity towards a better path, Ergoy being the ultimate and definitive proof of that.

In the beginning there was Losh and there was void and the turbulent waters of the primordial sea, then Losh separated the waters, revealing the land, then Losh shun like a million suns, this is the start of the first age, from the light of Losh a tree grew in the soil, from it the first man and first woman fell from the tree.
From the corners of the universe, darkness took form and it became True Evil, the perpetual deceiver
Losh defeated True Evil even before the world was created, even before the first star started to shine, from it Losh sealed True Evil in the void forever. Despite Losh imprisoning of True Evil, its influence clung unto Humanity, and from it Humanity deviated from

## History

- Founded in [720](https://winter.miraheze.org/wiki/8th_century "8th century"), Ergoy received a vision of **Lōš** the ancient fire god of [Berkke tradition](https://winter.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Berkke_tradition&action=edit&redlink=1 "Berkke tradition (page does not exist)"), from there on Ergoy started teaching and composed four books, later compiled into the [Isçamalirǰeǰ](https://winter.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Is%C3%A7amalir%C7%B0e%C7%B0&action=edit&redlink=1 "Isçamalirǰeǰ (page does not exist)") _Morning-Noon-Night_ the sacred book of all Loshians.
- In 723 Ergoy have had more visions about the current times and about the end-times.
- In [729](https://winter.miraheze.org/wiki/8th_century "8th century") Ergoy built the first Loshian temple in [Redeye](https://winter.miraheze.org/wiki/Redeye "Redeye"), people that were drawn to it became the first Loshians.
- In 778AGS Ergoy was persecuted and almost killed by people that opposed his teachings, he was persecuted and ostracized together with the newly Loshian converts.
- Ergoy died in the first month of 781, in his death bed he ordained his most devout follower [Famfuir Eç](https://winter.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Famfuir_E%C3%A7&action=edit&redlink=1 "Famfuir Eç (page does not exist)") to compile Ergoy writings and manuscripts into a single book that all shall know by the mouth of yours.
- From 780~782AGS Loshianism had become a widespread religion, Ergoy had enough money to buy a great place, more than one hundred people gathered together every end of the day to hear Ergoy and his ideas, most of these were new to the faith and were interested.
- The influence of Loshianism in Telehe regions wasn’t welcoming, many loshian groups fought the telehe to not be assimilated into their polytheistic faith.
- Traditional authorities and the priests of Traditional Berkke religion thought about their religion coming to an end due to potential growth of  Loshianism, they conducted heavy changes to their religion including equal rights to women and other drastic changes, after that many people returned but the temples once got empty, they knew the enemy was clever, the king rapidly became aware of this and conducted incursions againsts those who believed in any form of Loshianism, after 2 years of fight Loshianists won the battle, after that they decided to lead a revolution against the king, many attempts were made, the king needed to do something, he openly gave 30% of all traditional temples to the new Loshianists, but they’d need to pay higher taxes directly to traditional priests and temples.
- In 850 with the fall of Telehe empire the district of Berkke once free of Telehe commands, they now would rule like kings again, the Hautkar incursion that destroyed Berzun.
- After that Berkke people gained more authority, at the same time a shift of religions happened, while countryside maintained the polytheistic tradition, even the king would be converted, from there one could affirm Berkke kingdom were at most 70% Loshianists.
- The first big temple dedicated to the Losh religion would be built in 923AGS, finally Loshianists had a place where they could feel safe.  
    - The temple was a mix of Traditional Temples and new architecture methods, the temple was built under the first place Ergoy used to live and established the religion, Ergoy died many years ago, his body was buried under the temple.
- In 1000AGS Berkke kingdom was mainly Loshianist, majority of Traditional people migrated outside the kingdom to build their own nation, a group of five hundred people including several priests and people who felt disgusted by Loshianism, they migrated into Qachkav land and even north into Krobu lands, from there many small states devoted to the old Berkke Gods established themselves.
    - At this point the priests have gathered together and decided to reform their religion so they could integrate more and more people, for this the cult of feminine deities was adopted before that feminine deities weren’t worshiped by everyone, a system of casts were created and a canonical text called Hōčīė Lāurin \[xo̞ːˈc͡çɪːɤ ɫɐːɯ̯ɾin] “The path of the Gods” it was used by all Traditional people, they coined the name Kėri Gaū Lāurin “The people of one hundred Gods”.

### God and spirits

Losh is the only deity of Loshianism, he whoever shares his divine position with minor spirits, some may call it _minor deities_, making many believe Loshianism is a henotheist, but in fact it was never clarified what central ideal Loshianism go for.

### Cosmology and afterlife

The common knowledge, and described in the [Losh Yeremen](https://winter.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Losh_Yeremen&action=edit&redlink=1 "Losh Yeremen (page does not exist)") is, the world was created when Losh blew out of his lungs the primordial waters and from that he pushed the sun, the two moons and Koty itself from the waters, from there, Koty was full of sludge and algae, all burning in the sun, because it did not moved, it was static, Losh then made it so, the sun and moons would always move in the sky.

Afterlife in Loshianism is said to be simply a path you go when you die, if you practiced good deeds when you was alive, Losh spirits would judge you and send you to either the [Joçepteyu](https://winter.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Jo%C3%A7epteyu&action=edit&redlink=1 "Joçepteyu (page does not exist)") "eternal joy" or [Goroed](https://winter.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Goroed&action=edit&redlink=1 "Goroed (page does not exist)") "Hole".
