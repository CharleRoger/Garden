#empire #ansang
**Ansang Empire** was a thalassocratic empire in [[Southern Fountainhead]] that was based on the [[Ansang Islands]]. It existed from 670 to 1200 and reached its peak during the coming of the [[Lavondu]] once the knowledge of outside world came forth.

Official language [[Ansang Language]], during the rule of the [[Yuge dynasty]] the [[Yuge language]] was enforced; official religion [[Ansaŋetuʼakɨmi|Ansang traditional religion]].
# History
During the first century AGS, migration routes have been drawn by early Common Ansangic speakers settling in the eight islands that form the [[Ansang Islands]]. Speakers of [[Yuge language]] split up early and formed their own settlements alongside [[Ɨrsɨryuŋe]].
Those settlements functioned which evolved from an ancient network brought by the third and last migration wave, denoted the presence of a federation of small kingdoms or vassalized polity under a center of domination. These centers were called \[\[PLACEHOLDER]]....

Stablishing a network of confedered states, the Ansang created a pseudo-kingdom that still maintained each region independency but culturally and religiously aligned with with the [[Omboŋ]] state. Leaders were chosen by an election system, only men of high status were allowed to vote, this worked in small scale towns, for the entirety, a kingdom was elevated by the High Priests, 


Up until now they share similar culture, language, religion and culture, the island of [[Yuge]] however developed in its own way, having substantially different dialects and practices. 

In 200AGS, the tribe of Ɨrsɨrso'vunju' started a campaign to unite all Ansang islands, [[Ɨmbɨlo|Ɨmbɨlo Yuhaloko Yusambaimbai Eŋesse Yumbomboŋ Yuhuhuraomba of Ɨrsɨsovvunju’]] proposed all Ansang people should unify by peaceful meanings under one single institution with commercial and protection being the bond keeping all together, at first a confederation formed as [[Ɨmbɨlo]] visited and interacted with neighboring tribes with his troop of followers, they proposed laws and cultural morals that the leaders of each island had to agree if they joined. Following 21 (winter years) the newly formed confederacy helped each other thus this is considered the peaceful years, [[Ɨmbɨlo]] created an elective monarchy [[Ndende’ilin]] “Power by rank/vote”, with a corpus of laws called [[Ŋoit]] “Rules” with more than 20 laws, kings are elected by wealthy merchants their popularity defines their change to win, political debates were a common activity alongside a test [[Mbeurasso’]] “Great test” where a couple of 20 to 30 questions are asked, if all requirements are met, they’ll be run for king, the people who are allowed to vote are the wealthy merchants and richmen, then the emperor rules until their death, the emperor is however free to change anything it would require for both the populace and high priests to accept it, high priests must accept otherwise they can veto it. Emperors are called Ondonjɨye’eso’ “Emperor/Big king” they rule over all eight Ansang islands, calling it Asaysossilye’e ‘Big state of the living’ or Asayso’ansaŋ “Big state of all Ansang” or more commonly known as Releyaɨhoundermboracamo’ ”Boundaries of the eight islands”.

### 370AGS

Xirouta’ in his last years appointed his friend to be the next emperor as he trusted him of [[Yuge]] descendancy, although it was not prohibited for a king to appoint their next occupant, this raised doubts and eventual conspirations against this friend led the high priests prepare themselves for something much greater.

The emperor [[Xirouta’]] was admired and so was his friend, the populace fall in likeness with his friend, the populace then elevated [[Toho of Yuge]] status, from this period and on the [[Yuge dynasty]] would rule for 91 years, these following years [[Toho of Yuge]] plotted against the high priests and so mandated so that the elective monarchy moved to the hereditary monarchy, a new heir was declared. (400AGS).

Despite the [[Yuge dynasty]] breaking of laws the populace didn’t bothered, the years of [[Yuge]] ruling were as much peaceful as the last emperors, but the priesthood conspired against [[Yɨlomono of Yuge]] eventually deserting him in Continental Kóty near Ħautkar lands. It is suggested by many Ansang scholars, knowledgeable about the history of Ansang Empire that [[Yɨlomono]] is theorized to be [[Hiṣaṭ]] a Ħautkar leader that murdered his uncle [[Lenrek Mdari]] and married [[Mteni]] to become Bar-Ârcak, soon deposed by Ħautkar priesthood (just one year before [[Yɨlomono]] is also deposed by Ansang priesthood), ending the [[Second God Kingdom of the West]], some five years later the High priests reestablished the Elective Monarchy back, [[Loromanu]] the new chosen king reestablished.

### The gap

During the end days of [[Loromanu]], the economy of Ansang islands entered in a long lasting depression, rebellions and shaky political affairs, made the High priests wary of the state, they took over Ansang islands and then established a temporary theocracy, 180 years of theocracy slowed down the current trends of political depression and overpopulation. 

During the 668AGS the priests promptly ascended [[Colombae]] status and made him king, thus returning to the elective monarchy once more.

### 800AGS

In the reign of [[Xoxeŋe]], he was surprised with exciting news about unknown explorers that came from the island of [[Yuge]]. They were the [[Lavondu]] in their own tongue and science.

### Ansang colonization period: 900-980 AGS

Upon the arrival of [[Lavondu]] settlers, Ansang Empire was introduced to the trade system and outside world of far northern Fountainhead, with the provided knowledge of [[Lavondu]] of writing [[Opsíbdañox]] , Ansang scholars and commoners made use of it, in an uncensored way, many writing variants flourished and vanished through time.

Sought to expand its borders and extraction of raw materials upon population growth, the Ansang empire settled under the command of Mboxuya in the regions of [[Qnōp']], [[Krobu]] and [[Koyan]]. Diplomacy campaigns with the proposal of establishing safe trading routes and protection from the empire seemed promising (almost like a feudal system) and it made both sides happy, [[Nambāno]] people agreed for a limited time.

Five years have passed and [[Maŋembi]] son of [[Erero]] expanded even more the empires forces further inland.

Coastal [[Kóty]] is also taken by the Ansang becoming the strongest and most stable domains of the Ansang.

However, as time went by, the constant presence of Ansang didn't serve anything for the natives further damaging the soil and the local economy, Nambāno aristocracies divided upon this threat and unsatisfied, they fled further into land. The Ansang empire captured [[Psirin Aster]], a scholar well known for his travels and his acolytes were taken to the Ansang islands to serve the Emperor, he was specially well treated living in lavish rooms allowed to roam in the imperial palace but not much outside.  
Ansang ownership of [[Qnōp']] didn’t last forever, while [[Uhustaw]] is flourishing, Ansang is struggling to push towards Qnōp' highlands, never reaching their initial goal, this just drives more Nambāno to settle in Uhustaw, strengthening its position as an independent "state" of sorts, now able to politically and economically separate themselves from the lowlands and the Ansang. 

Following the uprisings and rebellions throughout the year 952AGS crops failed due to unsustainable farming under Ansang demands, further worsening the situation over the poorest parts of the empire and even the main [[Ansang islands]]. The empire withheld many war prisoners, scholars and priests from a variety of cultures all around the empire inflicting great anger upon them. [[Erero’oŋgoŋ]] was killed, the murderer remained unknown, the empire once more wasn’t prepared, [[Xipi]] a nobleman of a wealthy family that for two centuries helped Ansang empire flourish, forcibly took the throne, but his brothers were unsatisfied and wrathful of him and so they waged war against his actions. The High Priests coupled with [[Xipi]]’s brothers provided them Holy armies and the necessary support, while [[Xipi]] coupled with many other wealthy families to claim his ownership of the Empire. The civil war plagued the reign of [[Xipi]] for the next eight years exhausting the economy with unfeasible costs, Xipi campaign against his brothers and the High Priests killed them all, but at last, other wealthy families conspired against Xipi, he was assassinated (963 AGS). Ending the long run Ansang Empire had, engulfed by wrath and despair one last High Priest [[Ndoyamba]] and his acolytes hidden from all fled towards the [[Krobu islands]] in hope of new beginnings.
