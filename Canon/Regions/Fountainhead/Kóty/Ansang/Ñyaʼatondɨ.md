**Ñyaʼatondɨ** are local animal guardians that are known for being the vessel of the soul of diseased emperors through history, making the presence and vigilance of previous emperors timeless.
## History
### Tribal chiefs
There are evidence that even before [[Ansang people]] arrived in [[Ansang Islands]] the practice of transferring one's deceased soul into their pets has been an enduring tradition, with tribal chiefs being the most referenced in history suggesting this is somewhat reserved only for chiefs, possibly also performed in commoners but less referenced. 
### Emperors
[[Ɨmbɨlo]] the first Ansang emperor stablished a priesthood of three High priests, and with this [[Ansaŋetuʼakɨmi|Ansang religion]] became the state religion, many practices were now only reserved for the High Priests to perform, given the situation they were to bless the Emperors pet  
### Yuge dynasty 
[[Toho of Yuge]], friend and successor of [[Xirouta’]],  


### Deification of Emperors by the High Priests

## Ritual

## Mummification

Ansang emperors each and everyone has had a pet that when the emperor dies, his soul is to make a journey into his pet, together with the soul of previous emperors And so, the pet becomes a spiritual guardian to ward off evil/ancestral worship and vigilance into the new emperor The Yuge dynasty disrespected many rituals of the Ansang, and was built in secrecy, thus killing the pet containing the soul of previous emperors. After their crime was revealed the dynasty came to a collapse and thus the tradition was reestablished. To the wonder of the High Priests, many local priests and laymen already did that, these pets (containing the emperors soul) were merged with local spirits of the rivers, wind and mountains, thus stablishing many local cults (Just like of those of Greek Heroic cult)
