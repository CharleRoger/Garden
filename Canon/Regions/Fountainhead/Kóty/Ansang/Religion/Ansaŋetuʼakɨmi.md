### Shrines
Dedicated to many gods and goddesses, the traditional Ansang temple is the common place for the Ansang spirituality, many people come and go, they pray, consult priests for many matters, offer fruits, goods and gold to the gods. The temples are often located in the center of the village/city, this one, is the biggest Ansang temple located at the capital of the Ansang Kingdom (1000AGS), it has every manifestation of all the gods. There are future plans to expand the temple to accommodate more gods, a library, a garden and a meditation room. The current king was considering to help the temple with gold and many materials brought from the continent but the price is exorbitant, many considered donating to the temple, but until 1100AGS the temple remained the same, three years after construction started, but they left incomplete due to inflation over materials.

Earlier Ansang temples were much more organic and closer to nature than the novels ones, they were deeply in contact with nature and so were the people that frequent those spaces. Often near creeks and natural formations, these much older temples were build in a much unorganized way that accentuated the natural intervention of it, some temples may seem abandoned but they are just not used that often and so natures starts to reclaim it. At a first glimpse these temples follow much older architecture, some are made of wood and not bricks, and some are surrounded by Stonehenge like structure. Some of these temples are found in artificial hills, probably ancient funerary hills of forgotten people that became the ground for temples.

Essentially any space that has an Ansang person and some god imagery, be it statue or simply the name of the god, is considered a temple, Ansang religion by the time of 500~AGS was very cultural and ethnic, no one outside the native sphere of Ansang could be into the religion, this changed in 700~AGS when the religion open up for anyone to practice, now non-Ansang could practice it. Ancient places like Temples were blessed by the gods they are places for pilgrimage, soon they become landmarks and bigger than most Temples in Ansang islands. Newly constructed temples were also places for pilgrimage but not comparable to Ancient Temples.

### Prayers
Ansang religion is without a doubt diverse and plural on its way, where in a region prayers aren't spoken but in form of acts, in other regions they are spoken... The emphasis of Ansang religion is to worship the nature in form of the gods which are living agents of nature, they are manifestation of natural aspects and essence. Gods can make humans Gods but no Human can become a god by themselves. Naturally prayers are. 

- Light incense (Optional).
- Bow to the god.
- Clap three or four times (Optional).
- Bow deeply.

Essentially the prayer is done, some may customize their prayer with a few more steps and acts, some may insert spoken prayer. Prayers are done in an Altar dedicated to some god, while rituals are mostly done in Temples dedicated to some god.
