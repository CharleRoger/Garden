The new spirit faith is a syncretic faith born out of the [[Ansaŋetuʼakɨmi |Ansang traditional faith]], [[Oxlian Mysteries|local beliefs]] and superstition and [[Loshianism]] 




__**The destruction of self and the state**__
After the eminent fracturing of Ansang Empire, Ansang folk religion also suffered.
Trying to survive as a militarist religion, it did not went well with the stablished teachings of the gods, Priests wanted more than simple prayers. They also wanted complex rituals and total devotion to the gods, this only created sick minds and fanatic people, they could not explain why, but they wanted to kill someone for not praying correctly. 
The type of sickening teachings the current High Priest required was amazingly dangerous.
Panic, Chaos, Fanatic persecution to non-believers... All of this collectively lead to the destruction of the self and the state, religion itself was walking in thin ice before people stopping caring about all of this, and stopping care about the temples and the priests... They lost their credibility and pure status...
More people started to make their own home temples, despite all, everyone developed a secretive cult from the tyrant priests.
All of sudden, missionaries of Loshianism and Oshulism started to heavily influence religion in one of the main branches of the secretive cult, syncretism happened and a sorta of "henotheist view" dominated Secretive Ansang cult with this new idea Orim, Losh and Oshul are the same God and all other gods are a product of his mighty power and million faces, prior to this, this new religion was called
*`Ēǰėroday`* /e:dʒɤrodaj/ 'mixed spirits, mixed gods' loaned into Ansang *`Eyshërodʼey`* /ejʃərodʔej/. No more the folk religion of Ancient Ansang now corrupted by dirty and greedy priests, this was the new hope this was a new time, a new era! Ansang called this *`Baʼekas Dede`* /ᵐbaʔekas ⁿdeⁿde/ 'The Hope Time'.
**Yet another post about Ansang beliefs...**
This new religion in Ansang society influenced by monotheistic and polytheistic roots became divergent than any other religion in the continental Kóty, what was known to people as *God* was boiled down to the *Single-Spirit* *`Ïpeudʼouror`* the resultant syncretism between Orim, Losh and Oshul, gave rise to this new deity, it could be defined as the single force of nature; the wind, the waters, the ground, the sand, the stars and the trees, everything that made part of the nature was defined as the Single Spirit.

This new thought became practically the mainstream belief of many where ancient Ansang gods were almost forgotten. But in small period of time priest revolt and tried to get the old ways back in action, but as everyone shifted their attention to the new Single-Spirit, the elite and priest of this new religion decided to accept the old gods but they wouldn't be called gods but minor manifestations of the Single-Spirits, priest didn't quite understand this, their minds were too focused in the old ways than this *Manifestation thing*. 

With influence of Loshianism this new faith was centralized in temples, no more the folks could host their own alter, it is needed to go to a local temple, ancestral veneration could still be done, but otherwise, it wasn't simple allowed, exceptions were made but rarely accepted.

With influence of Oshulism, temples were always nature centered, with plans all over the place, and full of running water and fresh water.
