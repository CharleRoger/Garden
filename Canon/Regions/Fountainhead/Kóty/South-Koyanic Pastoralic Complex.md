The South-Koyanic Pastoral Complex or short SKP is a culture of the [[2nd century BGS]] till the [[3rd century]] AGS. It is directly ancestral to the [[Hnäzb people]] and took place during their expansion into the Red Steppe. The end of the SKP is traditionally marked by the advent of the mature Hnäzb culture and all its typical hallmarks. The SKP is generally assumed to be a transitional phase between the [[Northern-Koty Pre-Metallic Complex]] and the Hnäzb culture proper. Though the SKP is unmistakenly Hnäzbic in origin and the actual transition between the NKPM and its descendent was a rather short affair. For that reason the SKP is sometimes just called Proto-Hnäzb culture. 

## Lifestyle 

The people of the SKP were pastoralists, who herded cattle, goats, [[Mlomlo]] and foremost [[Ugo]]. The Ugo is the most valuable animal of the Hnäzb and core of their lifestyle. It can be assumed that the SKP lifestyle did not deviate very much from the known Hnäzb cultural hallmarks. The main difference is that the native elements of the Red Steppe are either lacking or have not yet been absorbed. The relation between the aboriginal people of the [[Red Steppe]] and the SKP is likely that of conquered and conqueror, while still in the process of mending into a cohesive society. Thus it can be assumed that the SKP still has a larger Koyanic element to it. 

### Relation between SKP and Hnäzb 

Hnäzb histories like to tell epic tales of legendary conquerors of old. One reoccuring theme is a heroic figure who lifts up his vassals from poverty. There is the motif, that before their rise, the Hnäzb were a pariah people and lived in poverty. This is probably a cultural memory relating to the end of the NKPM and its impoverishment and decline. During this collapse its members began to give up their settlements and became fully nomadic and acquired a lifestyle of raiding. Scholars like to paint these nomadic people as *parasitic* to the cultural carriers of the [[Old Krobu Maritime Culture|OKM]] culture. 
## Language

The people of the SKP spoke a Hnäzbic language. It is often assumed to be a late phase of [[Proto-Hnäzb language]] itself.
