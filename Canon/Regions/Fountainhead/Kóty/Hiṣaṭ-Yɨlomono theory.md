In around 400 [[Universal calendar|AGS]], [[Toho of Yuge]], king of [[Early Ansang kingdom|Ansang]], mandated that the monarchy would no longer be elective, but follow a system of hereditary succession, beginning the [[Yuge Dynasty]]. This may have been inspired by the "[[First God-Kingdom of the West]]", a hereditary monarchy established in the western [[Ħautar delûr|Ħautaric]] cities in 266 [[Universal calendar|AGS]]. The [[Yuge Dynasty]] lasted until 468 [[Universal calendar|AGS]], when it was deemed illegal by the high priests of [[Ansang Islands|Ansang]], who subsequently deposed the incumbent king [[Yɨlomono of Yuge]] and exiled him to the east.

The very same year, a previously unknown nephew of [[Lenre III|Lenrek mdari]], the controversial ruler of the newly restored [[Second God-Kingdom of the West]], emerged. This nephew usurped the throne, killing [[Lenre III|Lenrek mdari]] and marrying his widow, [[Mteni IV]]. His reign as [[Hiṣaṭ II]] lasted only one year before he too was deposed by the [[Ħautar priesthood]].

It was previously believed that he had been deposed due to the crimes of the murder of his uncle and the sacrilegious marriage to his aunt-by-marriage [[Mteni IV]], but [[Lenre III|Lenrek mdari]] himself had similarly killed the king of [[Dâmer-ṭegik]], [[Turen III]], to exert his claim to the throne and restore the [[Second God-Kingdom of the West|God-Kingdom]]. Though disliked, [[Lenre III|Lenrek mdari]] was able to rule for seven years unchallenged, which begs the question why was [[Hiṣaṭ II|Hiṣaṭ]] deposed when the [[Ħautar priesthood|priesthood]] did not act previously. Murderer or not, [[Hiṣaṭ II|Hiṣaṭ]] was the heir apparent, and his marriage, though sacrilegious, was a more certain claim to the throne than [[Lenre III|Lenrek mdari]] was ever able to prove, if [[Hiṣaṭ II|Hiṣaṭ]] was indeed who he alleged.

A now more popular theory suggests that [[Hiṣaṭ II]] was not the nephew of [[Lenre III|Lenrek mdari]], nor was he even of [[Ħautar delûr|Ħautar]] origin, but he was the exiled [[Early Ansang kingdom|Ansang king]] [[Yɨlomono]]. This is not confirmed, but various pieces of evidence support the idea. The [[Yuge Dynasty]] had established good relations with the [[New Kingdom of Dâmer-ṭegik]], something the [[Telehe Confederacy]] had failed to do despite their closer historical and geographical relationship, and [[Yɨlomono]] had visited the city several times in his reign. Additionally, an [[Early Ansang kingdom|Ansang]] ambassador who would certainly have recognised [[Yɨlomono]] is thought to have been in [[Leṣek-etku]] in 468-469, perhaps to settle their diplomacy now that the two cities were once again under a single rule.

After this little episode, the priesthoods of the [[Early Ansang kingdom]] and the [[New Kingdom of Dâmer-ṭegik]] met to attempt some kind of restoration or renovation of their respective monarchies, which took place around 5-6 years later. This kind of international cooperation was an unprecedented move by the traditionally ultra-conservative [[Ħautar delûr|Ħautar]], a measure taken deliberately against the imminently rising [[Telehe Empire]]. This opened up [[Dâmer-ṭegik]], and later the other [[Ħautar delûr|Ħautar]] kingdoms, to much more interaction with the other nations of [[Kóty]].
