The Old Krobu Maritime Culture of OKM was an early metallic culture, which was vastly successful and covered large parts of [[Krobu]] and extended into the northern reaches of [[Kóty]] and as far north as [[Qnōp']]. It contributed to the spread of the ancestors of the [[Nambāno]] and [[Arklobu]] peoples and languages. 

## Early OKM (7th - 4th century BGS)
Later scholars of ancient cultures developed two competing theories of how the OKM began. The first is the *Autochthonous Theory*, which states that the ancestors of the OKM, who were [[Koyanic languages|Koyanic]] people spread northward prior to the invention of metallurgy in [[Kóty]] and reached Krobu before the beginning or around the start of the [[1st millennium BGS]]. These people could have been part of the [[Northern-Koty Pre-Metallic Complex|NKPM]] culture, though some reject this notion also. When metallurgy began to spread from central Kóty during the 8th century BGS, the Koyanic people of Krobu adopted it and brought about the OKM. 
A variation of this theory speculates on the so called [[Old Bezgon Culture]], a southern extension, relative or ancestor of the OKM. The Old Bezgon culture is theorised to have existed from the 10th to the 5th century BGS. The problem is that the OB culture is hardly distinguishable from other forms of the NKPM and later seems just to be a regional type of the OKM. 

The competing theory is called the *Expansion Theory* and states that the northern reach of Koyanic languages prior to the invention of metallurgy did not extend beyond Bezgon and was likely even more southerly. The invention of metallurgy caused several waves of expansion and migration within central Kóty, which kickstarted the migration of Koyanic peoples into all directions. With their new metal tools, the OKM ancestors would rapidly colonise Krobu. The problem with this theory is the NKPM itself and its likely Koyanic affiliation. The Gäj languages would have formed a uniform block within northern Kóty, which begs the question, where the Urheimat of the Nambic languages was. 

Nonetheless migration and expansion did take place and the early OKM is primarily characterised by the spread of metalworking all around Krobu, with the exception of the cultural backwaters, which remain part of the NKPM. It is unclear why the people of the NKPM persisted without metalworking and despite increasing poverty for the following centuries. Maybe they simply saw no point in it, as metals did not immediately increase the efficiency of their lifestyle either. Trade with OKM sites allowed them limited access to metal tools in the capacity they needed. 

## Mature OKM (4th - 2nd century BGS)
The OKM reaches its cultural cenith and largest expansion, with several major centers in Krobu. OKM tools and artefacts can be found all over Krobu, reaching north as far as Qnōp'. Their southward reach is more limited though. They are found at the coastal regions of westernmost Koty, but do not reach into central Koty. [[Ansang Islands|Ansang]] also doesn't have OKM artefacts either. 

If scholars would make isotope analysis of the tools, one would find out that even those in Qnop were manufactured in Krobu and brought there by communities of traders, the active migration of metalworkers seems to have ceased and local elites "hoard" that knowledge. Maybe traders are also organised in guilds that monopolise certain trades. If one would examine human remains found in Qnop, one could find out that many were born in Krobu and migrated later in life to Qnop. If one would make genetic research, one would find out that some people that were born in Qnop did have ancestors in Krobu. 

It is unclear whether there was state-level organisation between different OKM sites during this time or whether villages and towns formed small independent units. However there was one cosmopolitan element in their society, which connected traders and artisans alike. Some people have theorised about 

At the same time as the OKM flourishes, the NKPM seems to collapse. During the 2nd century BGS the NKPM suddenly vanishes, with almost all settlements being given up in a matter of 40 years. What follows is a rapid transition to pastoralism.
