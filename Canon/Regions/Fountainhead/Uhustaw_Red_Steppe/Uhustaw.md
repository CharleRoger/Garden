The Uhustaw is a lush and fertile region located in easternmost [[Qnōp']] or right at the border of [[Oksandanderi]]. Its nature as endorheic basin lead to it having its own distinct geography and hydrology largely separate from the rest of Qnōp, also leading to various unique animals and plants in the region.

Its hydrology is dominated by several large, but with the exception of one, mostly shallow lakes. The lakes are surrounded by wetlands. Originally the area is highly forested, many of the native plants are endemic and in terms of their colouration, they are an offshot of the "red steppe" biome, albeit with its own forest variation of it. The forests are multicoloured and multilayered.

## Name
The land known as Uhustaw went by several different names, given by different peoples. The oldest known name is [[Čüüwän]], which was coined by the [[Hnäzb people|Hnäzb]] or [[Nespe]] people, but is likely derived from an older substrate term. It was speculated quite early already that it must be related to the [[High Alöbi|Alöbi]] term *cibwan* "to flood, spill over" and *cayibwan* "flood" 

A second name is *Siguonto* in the [[Nambāno]] language. It is derived from the word *siguon* with a similar meaning "floodplain". 

The [[Ardanic people]] people use the term *Uhustaw* most often, which can be segmentalised into Uh-us-taw. The element *-taw* is a locative honorific, which is added to names of large open areas. The part *Uh-us* can either be taken as *us* "lake" plus a "new" prefix *u-* or a simple plural "lakes". The second option is generally seen as more likely. 

In terms of political affiliation, Ardanic people used the term *Nespetaw* to refer to areas, which were inhabited, cultivated and under the juristiction of the Nespe people. Furthermore they also used the term *Nammanutaw* to mean the same thing for areas controlled by Nambāno people, although the borrowed term *Tutrema* was also used. 
Since the [[12th century]] the term [[Ayač-Arat]] became popular to refer to the state of the Uhustaw and its political organisation. 
## History 

### Ancient Period (prior to the 3rd century AGS)
Forager communities speaking [[Upic languages|Upic languages]] settled in the Uhustaw. After many centuries they establish their own agriculture and build sedentary villages. Their agriculture is limited mostly to horticulture, as they did not drain the extensive wetlands.   

### 211 AGS
By latter chronicles, it is estimated that the first Hnäzb settlers arrived in the Uhustaw, from then on known as the land of [[Čüüwän]] by the [[Hnäzb people]]. The exact date of [[3rd century|211 AGS]] was actually calculated by [[Psirin Aster]] many centuries later based on both oral and written chronicles. It should be taken with a grain of salt, as Psirin liked parallelism and 211 AGS is also the year when the three cities of the [[Tyon-Arat]] established their unity (Although that date was also estimated postfactum).  

### Mid-3rd Century
The powerful Hnäzb warlord [[Eight-Antler]] arrives in Uhustaw and establishes his realm there. Eight-Antler has two sons, whom he marries to the "daughters of the lakes". These daughters of the lakes are perhaps the daughters of powerful chieftains of previous polities, although in myth they appear as personified spirits of the lakes themselves, begotten by the lakes.  

### 340s AGS
The sons of Eight-Antler fight several wars against [[Red-Deer]], who was building another great Hnäzb realm on the steppes. Previously in [[4th century|323 AGS]] Red-Deer established his own realm, and in 331 AGS he raided and subjugated (made them pay tribute) seven great coastal cities. The sons of Eight-Antler did not lose in battle against Red-Deer, but their power was subsequently weakened and begins to decline.

It is said that the two sons of Eight-Antler had over forty children of their own, who inherited the land equally after the passing of their fathers. From now on for several centuries, no single united polity would rule over Čüüwän. Instead a feudal system of the forty noble lineages developed.

This feudal system is called [[Sat'öḫ stewardship]], named after the [[Sat'öḫ]], small forts which served a defensive purpose and around which hamlets and villages were build, which were under the protection and stewardship of a semi-nomadic nobility.  

### 861 AGS
The first [[Ardanic people|Ardanian]] expedition to the Uhustaw is launched. It is lead by [[Asin Erta]] (of the office of [[Kele]]). The expeditions consisted of 160 men and women, one third of which stayed in the new settlement, while the rest returned to the [[Ardanic Basin]]. The expedition was declared a success and new expeditions were launched in the following years.  

The first expedition founds the settlement of Uski "long lake" (Later called [[Üskin]]). The land itself is dubbed **Uhustaw** and its native people are called [[Nespe]] by the Ardanians. The names of the three lakes: [[Helek-Us]]"big lake", [[Irat-Us]] "northern lake" and [[Ukun-Us]] "southern lake" are, like most placenames, based on native terms from the Nespe language (or an older indiscernible substrate).  

### 938 AGS
Psirin Aster, who had long held an interest in the west, is tasked by the [[Martu|electors]] of [[Tyeleš]] to establish a town in the Uhustaw. The goal of this settlement was to establish a proper outpost, a colony featuring [[Ardanian government|Ardanian governance]] and bureaucracy. The expedition set out with over 700 people. In comparison, the earlier town of Uski at the time had barely gained a thousand inhabitants so far.  

The town founded by Psirin Aster would later bear the name [[Asterin-Nem]], although it is said, that Psirin himself preferred the name Kiwšah-Nem, after a local river. Much later the larger district would bear that name. The town was a build after Tyeleš itself and became something like a miniature of it.  

The land on which Asterin was build lay at the [[Küšäχ]] river slightly north of lake Helek. Several Nespe hamlets were given into the stewardship of Asterin in exchange for trading rights (The Nespe upper class is at the time still semi-nomadic, but severely impoverished, most Nespe people live in small hamlets strewn throughout the landscape. The changes in Qnōp' also made the Nespe lords nervous, as well as other [[Nambāno]] Ōmōda extending their reach into the Uhustaw).  

### 951 AGS
Psirin Aster and several of his closest companions leave the Uhustaw to embark on a journey to explore the further reaches of Qnōp and venture into the fabled south. In his absence [[Ksate Aster]] is made head of the [[Aster Itif|Aster]] [[Itif]] and subsequently authority over the settlement. 
### 952 AGS
[[Ayuf Aster]], previously first student of Psirin separates from their expedition and is send back to Asterin again. Upon return Ayuf would become the new leader of the Aster Itif. Psirin is taken captive, as well as his companions, his niece [[Hasif Aster|Hasif]], her partner [[Estin Aster|Estin]], [[Thana Aster|Thana]] and his son [[Ušmin Šipisti|Ušmin]]  
### 965 AGS
After the passing of Psirin in 960, his niece Hasif Aster remains in the lands of [[Ansang Islands|Ansang]], where she and Thana establish something akin to a sidebranch of their [[Itif]] and a school. Hasif herself is eventually allowed to leave, while none of the other Ardanians are (also to ensure their continued loyalty to the Ansang monarch).  

In the Uhustaw, Hasif brings back parts of Psirin's remains, as well as many of his [[Journals of Psirin Aster|writings]]. Though it is said she had a difference of opinion with Ayuf and turns her back on Asterin, instead fostering the fledgling town of [[Ayatma]], founded only a few years prior.  

### 970 AGS
Hasif leaves Ayatma again and ventures south to Ansang. Her successor in Ayatma is called [[Merin Nramaksa]]. Her small dispute with Ayuf Aster had the long term effect, that the towns in the Uhustaw remained basically self governing and weren't subserviant to Asterin alone. Each town of a certain size elected their own assembly and each assembly would elect an ambassador in the position of a [[Kele]] (minister). The various ambassadors would then need to establish a common policy through a separate assembly amongst each other, legitimized by the [[Martu]] (electors) of each settlement. In settlements too small, the general population made up the martu instead of electing a separate council, making the Uhustaw factually more base-democratic than the Tyon-Arat itself.  

Despite that autonomy, all settlements were still regarded as technically subserviant to their mother-cities in the Tyon-Arat. All settlements lacked the political offices of the [[Stera]] (senior ministers) and instead had governors legitimized and voted into office by the assemblies of the mother-cities. Additionally the governors and most officials were from a single itif and in Asterin most of them from the Aster itif, making the settlements essentially colonies founded by an itif. And an itif was usually hierarchical and had an appointed, not elected, leader. 
### 1015 AGS
Ayuf Aster passes away. He is succeeded by [[Esre Aster]] as governor of Asterin and leader of the Aster Itif.
In the coming years Esre would become very controversial, as many accused him of desiring to become a monarch. People would mock him by calling him **Esre Uwmuwta** (Ardanic spelling of Ōmōda).  

### 1019 AGS
People are fed up with Esre Aster and a [[Šrašipmi|small rebellion]] or civil war occurs. The office of governors is abolished and a grand assembly is established. Each town is recognised to elect their own member of this assembly, which would from then on rule over the Ardanian settlements collectively. The abolishment of the governor system puts the settlements at odds with the Tyun-Arat, as they lose political control over the Uhustaw settlements. People who live in the Uhustaw lose their civic rights within the Tyun-Arat as well. From then on, there are no more officially sanctioned expeditions send to the Uhustaw either. Further settlement from Ardanians to the west is mostly done by private individuals. Population growth is fascilitated internally mostly. 
### 1020s AGS
The period of the [[Ternary System]] (Ardanian, Nespe, Nambano harmony) begins. The Uhustaw becomes a sort of Ethnarchy in which settlements can establish their own laws according to their own ancient customs. However each settlement, be it Ardanic, Nespe or Nambano is invited to send a delegate to the grand assembly deciding on matters important to all members.  

Ardanian settlements either vote directly on their delegate or have a council of elected martu, which send a Kele delegate.
Nespe settlements continue a modified version of the stewardship system, in which a caste of semi-nomadic hereditary nobles take on responsibility for a group of settlements. Areas governed by this system fall into the category of **Nespetaw** (Nespe-land).  
### 1146 AGS
The polity of the Uhustaw is formerly recognised and emancipated by the Tyun-Arat, thus being equal to a formal recognition of independence (although phrased a bit differently). From then on the Ardanic name for the polity as a whole is [[Ayač-Arat]] (Fourth Homeland).
