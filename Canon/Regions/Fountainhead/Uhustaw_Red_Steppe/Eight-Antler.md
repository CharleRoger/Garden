Eight-Antler (as in Antlers with eight points) was a [[Hnäzb people|Hnäzb]] or early [[Nespe]] warlord and conqueror who lived during the [[3rd century]]. According to later estimates he arrived in the [[Uhustaw]] (Then [[Čüüwän]]) in the year 211 AGS and took it as his own, subjugating the native population. Soon he would rule over one of the mightiest early Hnäzb realms. 

His two sons would marry the "daughters of the lakes", which appear in the legend as the physical emanations of the spirits of the great lakes of the land. Though others have interpreted it to mean that they married the daughters of preexisting chieftains of the land. 

It is not known when Eight-Antler died, but at some point his sons inherited the realm in equal measure. His sons would eventually fight wars against other powerful Hnäzb, such as the mighty [[Red-Deer]]. Eventually though the sons of Eight-Antler could not defeat their enemies and the conflict ended in a stalemate. After the death of his two sons, the realm was inherited by their progeny of forty. Subsequently the power of the realm declined and it fractured, developing into the [[Sat'öḫ stewardship]] system, a feudal-like system, which would prevail in Čüüwän for the following centuries.
