Red-Deer or **Taałndzı-Řaba** was a powerful [[Hnäzb people|Hnäzb]] warlord of the [[4th century]] AGS. Red-Deer is credited with founding the first great [[Qneček]] and to conquer seven cities of [[Nambō]] and surrounding areas. Red-Deer become the quintessential Hnäzb warlord, whom others tried to emulate for centuries. 
## Early Life 
Most of the early life of Red-Deer is shrouded in mystery. It is not known when he was born, but there are legends, which tell that his mother was foretold the arrival of a great conqueror. Some say his father was a ugo-demigod or a mountain spirit or that is mother was a daughter of the sky. 

Red-Deer gathered followers early in life and became a charismatic leader. The year **320 AGS** is traditionally held as important, as he would take leadership of five tribe and form a Qneček. The organization of a Qneček may or may not have existed before in Hnäzb society, but Red-Deer utilised its whole potential. Within a few years he began to build a great realm. 
## The Great Warlord 
Over the next decades Red-Deer would attack the cities of the coastland. It is said that in 331 he won his greatest victory. In a single campaign he subjugated seven cities and made them pay tribute, made them slaves and took their ugo and all their other livestock or so it is told on the many memory stones that Red-Deer erected. 
The Hnäzb were not a literate people, but during his campaigns Red-Deer saw that the Nambāno erected stelae to commemorate their leaders. He did not understand the words written on them, but he copied some of them to mark his own victories. The exploits of Red-Deer remain a common and popular topic within Hnäzb art. 

## Death and legacy 
In 362 AGS Red-Deer would succumb to an illness and he chose his second-born son [[Silver-Eye]] to be his successor. From them on it would be Hnäzb custom that a leader would chose their successor. There was no fixed line of inheritance and thus realms remained very unstable. If a leader would die, it was brother against brother and kin against kin, making the many Hnäzb polities generally short lived. 

Yet Red-Deer would remain in Hnäzb memory as one-of-a-kind. His realm and his reign alone would found many traditions for the coming centuries.
