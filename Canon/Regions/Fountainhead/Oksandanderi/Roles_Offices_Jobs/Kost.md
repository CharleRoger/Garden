The Kost are traditional priests of [[Oksandanderi]]. They originate in the [[Traditional Oksandanderian faith]], but their importance has transferred over into the newer religious movements of [[Kamalism]] and [[Sumalism]] as well. They exist wherever religious movements have state patronage. During the earlier history of Oksandanderi they were important political leaders. This changed during the [[Kost-Kort Conflicts]], where their political position was largely usurped by the [[Kort]], military leaders turned kings and nobles. The last city, which was run by a Kost theocracy was [[Imnagal]].
