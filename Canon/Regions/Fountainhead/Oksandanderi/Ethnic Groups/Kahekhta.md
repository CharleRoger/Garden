Kahekhta (pl. Kahekhtát) is a name given to the tribal people, who continue to live by the [[Kas]], the customary traditional law of the [[Yarlish people]] of old. 

Most Kahekhtát are found in the Highlands, such as the [[Ván-Enne]] and [[Kupsa Erete]], but also many of the nomadic people of the upper Lowlands, such as the inhabitants of the [[Kupal mountains]] and the plains south of the [[Ésseri]] and [[Kamal]] belong into this category. In essence it is a name given to rural people, whose society is not fully controlled by the centers of power in the cities. 

To be regarded as Kahekhta, the following criteria should be met. 
- There are no hereditary leaders above the family-level.
- There are no professional soldiers, all adult men are considered potential warriors.
- There is no level of organization above the village level, communities do not exceed several hundred people at maximum. 
- Communities do not pay taxes or tributes to each other, but can occassionally raid others. Thus there is no centralised resources allocation among different communities.
- There are no professional priests. Priests are chosen by other priests. There are no temples. 
- Religious practice is done at shrines, public spaces, a [[Yorp building|Yorp]] or in sacred spaces in the wild. 
- People live by the [[Kas]], laws are determined by the community itself alone and an elected group of elders serves as judges.
