The Ván-Enne Alliance was a short-lived rump state which was founded after the dissolution of the [[Makhatganda]]. The majority of the population were either of [[Makhat]] ethnicity or from the many [[Ván-Enne]] people, speaking the indigenous [[Vándurn]] languages. 

During the [[11th century|1070s]] AGS the [[Empire of Kalotgane]] began to push against the Makhatganda, resulting in the [[Makhat-Kalotgane War]] and the defeat of the Makhat. At the end of this war the [[Council of Thirty]] decided to surrender, which lead to the dissolution of the state and the subsequent founding of several rebellious factions. These were the Ván-Enne Alliance, the [[Northern Government at Elghëday]] and the [[Dominion at Zhürme]]. The Ván-Enne and the Northern Government were supported by the [[Tyon-Arat]], who in fear of an invasion of their own homeland propped those rump states. The Ván-Enne were first approached by [[Kselin Etta]], a [[Suf|state official]] in 1080 and the two joined forces. The same offer was made to the Northern Government, which was initially successful, until the city of [[Elghëday]] was hit by a famine and surrendered to Kalotgane. 

The Alliance between Tyon-Arat and the Ván-Enne would continue and together they would brace the invasion of the year [[12th century|1111]]. After their victory, the Ván-Enne would be integrated into the Tyon-Arat as the [[Kupsa Psana|Kupsa province]].
