The Makhatganda was a majority [[Yarlish people|Yarlish]] state located within the [[Central Highlands]] of [[Oksandanderi]]. It lasted from the year [[4th century|331]] AGS till [[11th century|1076]], when it was annexed by the [[Empire of Kalotgane]], after its surrender in the the [[Makhat-Kalotgane War]]. It was one of the largest and most influential states in Oksandanderian history. 
## Prehistory 
The [[Central Highlands]] of Oks. have been inhabited by humans for thousands of course. Among the earliest discernible cultures is the [[Roundhouse culture]] or Ulitin culture. This culture prospered around [[6th millennium BGS|5000 BGS]] until its demise during the [[4th millennium BGS]]. The culture itself is named after its most prominent buildings, large round or rounded (often eight-sided, reminiscient of the [[Yorp building]]s of later centuries). After the Roundhouse culture declined, a sort of habitation gap set in and there were no traces of sedentary peoples living in the highlands for over a thousand years. 

Around the beginning of the [[3rd millennium BGS]] new neolithic cultures emerged in the Highlands, common called the [[Neolithic Highland Culture]], which was situated next to the [[Kapkhanda Agricultural Complex]]. It shared many innovations with said culture. It is thought that during this time speakers of [[Yarlish languages]] spread around Oksandanderi. People who'd be later known as the [[Ván-Enne]], speaking the [[Vándurn]] languages probably migrated into the highlands during this time period. 
## Erkhanda 
Before and after the inclusion into the [[Astmergian Empire]], the regions of the Highlands were collectively known as Erkhanda, literally "elevated country". Unlike the people of the Lowlands and along the middle and lower [[Yarla]] river, they did not yet form state-organization and persisted to live in tribal groups. Nonetheless they traded with the [[Yarlish Lowlanders]] and played an important part in their economy. The Highlands were an important source of copper, which was transported down the Yarla and traded in the ancient city of [[Pakkan]]. 

During the conquests of [[Astmerge the Great]], the future emperor laid his eyes on this profitable trade and sought to control its source. Astmerge conquered Pakkan in [[2nd century|161]] AGS, but this had at first the reverse effect of collapsing the copper trade alltogether. None of the merchants from the Highlands wanted to engage with the conqueror, who had just raided their most trusted trade partner. In a series of rather confusing events Astmerge decided to attack the realm of [[Kamal]], another hub of copper mines, but was defeated by the Kamalites instead. This defeat made the decision final to head upriver and attack the Highlands directly, which he did in 162 AGS. He remained on campaigns in the mountains until 164 AGS when he returned victoriously and built his new capital [[Kalotgane]] been build. There he declared himself to be the Lord of the Lowlands and the Highlands. After this victory his conquests ceased and he began building several [[Astmergian colonial cities|new cities]] to administer his realm. In 172 AGS the city of [[Vánarv]] would be build as capital of the Erkhanda province. In a similar style several thousand people from all over the empire were made to settle in an around Vánarv. In a short time period a functioning city was build there and populated with people loyal to Astmerge.

The city and its inhabitants and system would outlive Astmerge himself. When he died in 210 AGS, two political factions arose, which flocked to two different heirs. While the previous system was kept alive in the new cities, the old powers actively obstructed them. This conflict lasted until 267 AGS when [[Kalotgane]] itself was attacked and destroyed and most of its population left or was driven away. 

Due to its location far away from the center of the empire, Vánarv was not involved in these battles. Instead the city continued as it had before and the Astmergian system ran smoothly as it could. The inhabitants of the city, nobility, bureaucrats, priests and artisans consisted mostly of Astmergian loyalists from the Lowlands. The surrounding farms were run by people who came from all over the empire, both voluntarily and as slaves. The surrounding mountains were still dominated by the mountain tribes, of which many sought to cooperate with the city, although some actively opposed it. However after the last remnants of the Empire were destroyed, even Vánarv gradually became weaker and the situation eventually escalated into a civil war.
