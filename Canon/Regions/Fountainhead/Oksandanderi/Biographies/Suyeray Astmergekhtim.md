Suyeray Astmergekhtim ([[10th century|982]] in [[Vërev]] - [[11th century|1092]] in [[Kalotgane]]) was the first Emperor of the [[Empire of Kalotgane]], member of the [[Astmergekhtim Dynasty]] and one of the most influential rulers in [[Oksandanderi]].

## Early Life
Suyeray was born in the city of [[Vërev]], ancient city of his family line. His family had ruled over the city before as kings and descend from the ancient line of [[Astmerge the Great]]. Around a hundred years prior to his birth, the [[League of Kalotgane]] was founded, after Vërev had successfully conquered and reestablished the ancient royal capital. 

## Ascendence to the Throne
Suyeray became King of Kalotgane and Vërev in the year 1016 AGS, after the death of his father. Suyeray largely carried forth the legacy of conquests of his predeccessors. In the year 1020 AGS he lead an additional expedition for the pacification of the [[Walkenian people|Walkenian]] north and established the [[Northern Protectorate of Kalotgane|Northern Protectorate]]. Almost three decades prior in 994, the [[Northern Walkenian State]] was conquered by Kalotgane and the [[Walkenian Civil War]] ended once and for all. 
After this assertment of power, Suyeray decided to proclaim himself the [[Kathandu Kanda Kortle|Lord of the Eight Regions]] and Lord of the Lowlands and the Highlands and thus claiming the succession of Emperor Astmerge. 

Suyeray would establish the first [[Ahëvayldo]] festival, an annual festival taking place in the royal capital and all provincial capitals as well. 

## War against Makhatganda
See also [[Makhat-Kalotgane War]]

During the middle of the [[11th century]] the [[Empire of Kalotgane]] became one of the most powerful polities in Oksandanderi, but it was not yet the sole uncontested hegemon of this region. Suyeray considered his empire to be imcomplete without the [[Erkhanda]] region, which was under the control of the [[Makhatganda]], the second large state in Oks. 

The war against Makhatganda started in the year 1074. It is said that his force was at least three times larger than anything the Makhat could put up. Despite the odds, the [[Makhat]] could initially repel the invasion. During the Battle of [[Pakkan]] they won against the much larger force. This victory however was a Pyrrhic victory. Essentially weather and the encroaching winter were what saved the Makhat. However essentially they were besieged now. The forces of Suyeray could hold a siege just south of Pakkan throughout the winter, while the victorious Makhat troops were trapped. The allocation of soldiers towards Pakkan also lessened control over the [[Eastern Territories of the Makhatganda|Eastern Territories]] leading to sparks of new rebellions growing stronger over the following winter. The following spring and summer of 1075 didn't lead to any further conclusions. On the other hand, now all that Suyeray had to do was holding out until the siege broke the Makhat. The Makhatganda was in a dangerous situation. While they could in theory defeat the invaders, doing so would have a heavy toll on them, perhaps too much to bear. With 1075 coming to a close, the [[Council of Thirty]], the government of Makhatganda, made a final decision. They surrendered. They would join the Empire of Kalotgane, simply for the sake of ensuring no further damage to their people and essentially to save themselves too. With this decision, on the year of 1076 the state of Makhatganda once again became the province of Erkhanda and part of the Empire of Kalotgane.

## Later reign 
Suyeray's largest concern was with the full integration of all provinces in the empire and the establishment of the [[Imperial Cult]]. After his victory against Makhatganda, his efforts were concentrated on suppressing rebellions in the newly conquered territories, as well as pacifying the aristocracy at home. Suyeray would die in the year 1092 after a long and successful reign.
