Psirin Aster (845 in [[Tyeleš]] - 960 in the [[Ansang Empire]]) was an [[Ardanic people|Ardanian]] scholar, bureaucrat, explorer and founder of the town of [[Asterin-Nem]] and one of the most important political figures of the [[10th century]] in [[Oksandanderi]] and the early history of the [[Uhustaw]]. He largely spearheaded the Ardanian settlement of the Uhustaw, as well as the establishment of diplomatic relations with the people of the west, including [[Nespe]] and [[Nambāno]]. During the early 950s he embarked in a journey, from which he would not return and which ultimately brought him into the confines of the [[Ansang Empire]], where he spend the last years of his life. His [[Journals of Psirin Aster|journal]] from this time are seen as invaluable historical documents. 

## Early Life (845-875)
Psirin was born in the city of [[Tyeleš]], which is regarded as the home of foremost scholars among the [[Ardanic people]] and one of the three great cities of the [[Tyon-Arat]], as well as one of the oldest cities in [[Oksandanderi]]. Psirin stems from an influential and erudite family. His grandmother was a renown [[Kaluy]] (doctor) who became known after restoring the eyesight of one of the city's [[Stera]] (senator). This allowed her to establish her own [[Itif]] by the name of [[Aster Itif|Aster]] "meritable". Psirin received an education befitting his background and became a [[Suf]] in the year 869 AGS at the age of 24 (17). After that he pursued an education as an [[Erti]], which was contrary to most other members within the itif, who were educated in medicine instead. It is said that he was a rather unsteady young man and rarely stayed within one occupation for long and instead desired to travel a lot. Despite becoming an Erti in name, a typical government office was befitting to him. The traditional fields of knowledge of an Erti include geometry, mathematics, diplomacy, tolls and taxes, as well as linguistics. Some speculate that Psirin chose this career only because he could leave his hometown early and received the chance to travel around his homeland. The occupation gave him the opportunity to meet [[Asin Erta]], the first traveller to the [[Uhustaw]], personally. 
## Life as a Traveller and Scholar (875-910)
Psirin did not desire to stay within the occupation of a government Erti, being mostly limited to measuring plots of land and solving disputes between landholders. Instead he chose it as opportunity to travel. During the first years after finishing his education, Psirin more or less vanished and travelled western [[Oksandanderi]] for several years. He mostly did so and collected folk tales, stories and histories, as well as linguistic data. Something which was also of particular interest were tales of people who were in contact with people from the outside, such as from [[Irimri]] or those who had made dealings with [[Hnäzb]] people. 

During the summer of [[9th century|881]] he went out to retrace the journey the [[The Embassy of Peace and Friendship]] took almost thirty years prior. He spent around two years in Irimri, after which he returned to Tyeleš. In his home city he was received with mixed feelings at first. During the mid 880s he made his first contributions to the [[Theyteče Arapa|House of Knowledge]] in Tyeleš. The first was a tome called [[On the rites of the Threefold Homeland]], a comprehensive and historical work on the mythologies, religious practices and believes of the [[Ardanic people]]. While it earned him some recognition, it didn't earn him much praise. Another collection called the [[Laws of Rites]] extended the scope on the whole of Oksandanderi and tried to summarise the manifold religious landscape found in Oks. 
Psirin displayed a particular interest in the vernacular believes and sought to document them instead of trying to be a philosopher or prophet on his own. In Tyeleš he also met Asin Erta again, who took interest in Psirin's interest for languages, especially those of the newly explored regions outside of Oks. 
Asin, approaching his senior years, gave him the offer to accompany him on one of his journeys westward. 

During the year 890 he travelled to the [[Uhustaw]] for the first time with Asin and his itif. Although also being offered the opportunity, Psirin declined joining Asin's Itif as well. He spent at least six years in the town of [[Üskin]], where he learned the languages of the [[Nespe]] people, as well as the [[Nambāno]]. Psirin also spend a considerable amount of time studying and documenting the customs and believes of these peoples. During the winter of 896 to 897 however Asin Erta passed away after a sudden illness. This left Psirin in a difficult position, as he was now left without a patron or guide in Üskin. In the coming spring he would return to Tyeleš once more and bring all his writings there to be copied in the House of Knowledge. While he had gained now more fame to his name, the relationship to his own Itif was somewhat complicated. For the next coming years Psirin would return to the life as a wandering scholar, traveling parts of Oks. as well as occassionally returning west as well. 

During the years between 908 till 910 something akin to a succession crisis occured within his itif, after the former leader, a distant cousin of his, had passed away as well. This lead to some confusion and different factions forming on who should lead the Itif in the future. During these events Psirin could garner a lot of support and eventually became the new leader of the Aster Itif. While this elevated Psirin and gave him a position of power and influence, he never had before, it also grounded him and bound him to his position in Tyeleš. 
## The veritable Teacher (910-938)
Since 910 Psirin became the leader of the Itif founded by his grandmother over a century prior. He established a school in Tyeleš and expanded on the diplomatic aspect of the office of Erta greatly. His school became concerned with the exploration of distant lands, as well as the training of diplomats, although most of their early students were merchants who were looking for opportunities to trade in the west. 

In 912 he took in the young [[Ayuf Aster|Ayuf]] as his first student (a particular position within an Itif). Not having married, nor having children otherwise, Psirin treated Ayuf like his own son. Although one has to say that the relation between student and teacher within an Itif usually takes such a connotation anyway. 

During his time in Tyeleš, Psirin composed many scholarly works, most of them dealing with linguistics, languages and didactics. He deviced a grammatical description of the [[Ardanic language]] and introduced a set of grammatical terms, which elevated the grammarian tradition of his people. Furthermore he laid down the groundworks for the disciplines of phonology and phonetics, by creating a phonetic version of the [[Ardanic alphabet]]. He also used these innovations to deal with the transcription of foreign languages. 
## First Governor of Asterin (938-951)
Although Ardanic people had ventured to the [[Uhustaw]] for over half a century by now, the population of Ardanic settlements within it grew rather slowly. The town of Üskin had not even reached more than one thousand inhabitants. Most people who ventured into the west were merchants and few of them remained in the west. While some did remain there and even intermarried with locals, connections remained sparse. 
At the same time, the Three Cities of [[Tyon-Arat]] felt like they were losing control and colonists were getting out of their grasp. Essentially they were reaping none of the benefits of the early exploration. Those people who did eventually settle in the west felt no further obligations towards their homeland and were considered lost causes even. 

The Tyon-Arat felt that the time had come to establish a proper city in the west. One which was under steadfast Ardanic control, where Ardanic laws were practiced and which would attract further settlers from the homeland. The [[Martu]] of Tyeleš felt that Psirin was just the right person for the job and tasked him with founding a settlement according to their liking. So he set out in the year 938 with around 700 people, either from his Itif or associated with it. Along the shores of the [[Küšäχ]] river, which flows into the [[Helek-Us]] they build the town of [[Asterin-Nem]]. This town would feature its own [[Marte Arapa]], the House of Electors. Additionally it had another institution known as [[Sula Arapa]] "House of Guests" or later also dubbed the *Uwmuwta Arapa* "House of Nambāno Lords", a diplomatic institution, which served to invite foreign delegates and lords to discuss diplomatic matters and solve problems. 

The following years would be of immense success. Already in 940, almost a thousand new settlers had arrived in Asterin alone and the town outnumbered all other Ardanic settlements in the Uhustaw. Soon other towns began to copy the structure of Asterin and Asterin's inhabitants would even leave to establish new settlements in the surrounding areas like [[Kiwšah-Nem]], [[Ayatma]], [[Usāma]] or [[Sas-Nem]] and [[Yümüstem]]. 
## Last Expedition and Life on Ansang (951-960)
By the late 940s Psirin had become somewhat unresting. He was very much satisfied with how Asterin developed, but personally wanted to travel further, now that things were running smoothly. He was planing for what he considered his "last expedition", taking with him only several of his dearest friends and confidents. 

He would give up the position of governor to [[Ksate Aster]] and embarked on his journey in early 951. His group consisted of twelve people in total. They travelled down the [[Mibassā]] river first until they came to the coast and travelled south from there on. They spent some time in the delta of the [[Tmohassā]]. From there their group would take the journey by boat and arrive somewhere close to [[Krobu]]. Unbeknownst to them, another threat was developing in the south. As the [[Ansang Islands|Ansang]] King [[Erero’oŋgoŋ]] had passed away shortly before the beginning of their journey, regions under the control of the [[Ansang Empire]] were in disarray. Furthermore the new King [[Maŋembi]] was setting out to claim some of the Ansang colonies as his domain and reaffirm his rule there. 

Psirin's group finally split up upon facing danger. He sent Ayuf back north to the Uhustaw and proclaimed him the new leader of his Itif, while insisting on travelling further himself. He was accompanied by his niece [[Hasif Aster|Hasif]], her partner [[Estin Aster|Estin]], his close friend [[Thana Aster|Thana]] and his son [[Ušmin Šipisti|Ušmin]]. In the town of [[Ndarus]] they were captured by Ansang soldiers and Psirin identified himself and his group as envoy from a foreign government. This worked and they managed to be put under the protection of the Ansangite authorities. 

Psirin's group would be brought to the island of [[Embeti]], first, one of the many [[Krobu islands]] and home to an Ansang colony. They spent several weeks there until they were split up. Psirin, not knowing the fate of his companions was brought to the island of [[Yuge|Ürsüryuge]], where he would wait several more weeks. Apparently the king of Ansang was informed of his presence and put him under personal protection. Psirin had to wear a necklace akin to a slave, which factually made him the king's property. While on Yuge was allowed to roam the island, but was not allowed to leave it. After months of waiting he was finally brought to the Ansang main Island [[Ürsürinehüra]] to meet with King Maŋembi, whom he liked to refer to as the King of Thousand Islands. After a brief audience with the king, Psirin was dismissed again and would not meet him ever again. Yet he was given several tasks. The king wanted to know about his homeland and profit from his knowledge. Psirin could reunite with his companions and they all were to build a school and to teach the Ansang people. While their freedom of movement was extended, none of them was allowed to leave the main islands. On Ansang he would spent the last years of his life, until passing away in 960. His companions were forced to stay on Ansang for a while. His niece Hasif was allowed to return to the Uhustaw with some of his remains according to Ardanic customs. Neither Thana, Estin nor Ušmin were allowed to leave and Ušmin was not even allowed to leave after his father died. Their fates however would be intertwined with the coming history of the [[Ayač-Arat]] and the [[Ansang Empire]] too.

His last journey was documented by himself and his companions in their [[Journals of Psirin Aster|travel journals]] and became an important historical source for later generations.
