The history of [[Oksandanderi]] spans several millennia. It covers the early neolithic, bronze age and the advent of writing and large states. 

## Paleolithic Horticulturists (5500 - 4000 BGS) 

## Neolithic Agriculturalists (3800 - 1500 BGS) 

## Early Bronze Age (1500 - 700 BGS) 

## Formative-Literary Period (700 - 300 BGS) 

## City-State Period (300 BGS - 164 AGS) 

## Astmergian Period (164 - 267)

## Era of Fragmentation (267 - 512)

The Era of Fragmentation is often thought of as one of chaos and warfare, but also of immense cultural development, which would pave the way for all following political and religious ideas that originated in Oksandanderi. This Era is preceded by the event of empire building and the first time of large political unity in Oks., which resulted in the following desire to replicate this unity. Several states aimed at mantling the prestige of the Astmergian Empire, but none came close. This resulted in many wars between city states and petty empires. Indeed this development is not all that different from how Oks. developed in the time before Astmerge rose to power. However this time the experience of unity had shaped thought and ideas and created a inter-regional identity. 
## Four Kingdoms Period (512 - 710) 

## Era of Harmony and Disharmony (710 - 1020) 

## Imperial Age (1020-1500)
