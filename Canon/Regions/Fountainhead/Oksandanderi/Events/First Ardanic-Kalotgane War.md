The First Ardanic-Kalotgane war was series of military conflicts between the [[Tyon-Arat]] and the [[Empire of Kalotgane]]. It took place from the [[11th century|1080s]] till the year [[12th century|1111]] AGS and resulted in an [[Ardanic people|Ardanic]] victory. 

## Prelude 
The conflict between the Tyon-Arat and the Empire of Kalotgane was already on the table during the early [[10th century]], when Kalotgane hast begun to conquer most of the Lowlands of [[Oksandanderi]]. An all out war would not happen for another century though. At the same time, the Ardanians began to increasingly focus on their eastern border during this time. One major development within the Ardanian state was the rise of the [[Renewal and Emancipation faction]], which aimed at centralising the state and emancipating the outer provinces to strengthen internal unity in the case of war. 

The actual war came closer during the 1070s, when [[Makhat-Kalotgane War|Kalotgane went to war]] against the [[Makhatganda]]. In 1076 the [[Council of Thirty]] surrended and the Makhatganda was dissolved. Yet there were many factions, who were quite unhappy with this decision and several rump states formed out of it. For one there was the [[Northern Government at Elghëday]] and the [[Dominion at Zhürme]], as well as the [[Ván-Enne Alliance]], which would play a larger role for the Ardanians. 

## Ván-Enne Alliance and Proxy Wars 
After the Makhatganda imploded, the Ardanian [[Krut|military]] [[Suf|officer]] [[Kselin Etta]] approached the leaders of the [[Ván-Enne Alliance|Ván-Enne]] mountain peoples and offered them a military alliance, which they agreed to. The same happened with the [[Northern Government at Elghëday|Northern Government]] as well. In the case of the Northern Government however, it remained a futile effort. The Ardanians could not maintain supply lines to [[Elghëday]], and although the endeavour seemed successful in the first few years, a famine threatened the city and it surrendered to the Empire of Kalotgane. 

In the case of the Ván-Enne Alliance, their efforts were more successful and they could maintain the independence of the highlanders, while at the same time weakening the Empire. This alliance would furthermore pave the way for the full integration of the Ván-Enne into the Tyon-Arat.
