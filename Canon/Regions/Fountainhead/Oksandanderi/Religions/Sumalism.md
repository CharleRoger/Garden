Sumalism is one of the main religions of [[Oksandanderi]]. Like [[Kamalism]] it originated during the [[History of Oksandanderi#Era of Fragmentation (267 - 512)|Era of Fragmentation]], following the demise of the [[Astmergian Empire]]. It is commonly believed that Sumalism is an offshot of Kamalism. This is not entirely certain though. Sumalism might be older or it might not be, as the direct sources from the supposed time of origin of either religion are scarce. Both ultimately originate from the [[Traditional Oksandanderian faith]]. 
The main difference between Kamalism and Sumalism is one of pragmatism vs idealism. Kamalism does not have a *goal* in mind. It is about the mitigation between forces and a natural and spiritual balance. Sumalism on the other hand wants to create something bigger, something eternal and perfected. Cultivation is not just something to keep the wheel spinning, but something to bring the vehicle to another goal, to create a new state of being. There are mainy ideas of how this new stage might look like, but ideas about eternity are tied to goodness. Some connect Sumalism to the [[Ardanic people|Ardanic]] idea of the [[Haywa Ke'aksa Hta≈° Ukure|Six cycles of righteous guidance]], which proclaim that during every new age a new teacher will appear to give something new to humanity.
