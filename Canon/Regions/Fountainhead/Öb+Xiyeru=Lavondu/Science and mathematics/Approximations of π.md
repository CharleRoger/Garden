The [[Xiyeru]] have studied geometry for as long as they have been measuring things, which far predates the written mathematics and number theory of [[Inaʼaro Faweʼēyezuravujuweu]] and [[Huxŭkală]]. Pythagoras' theorem for example was already known and actively used by the [[Xiyeru]] before even the [[Savamāri|inception of writing]] c. 500 BGS. Another fact, that the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, π, is a little bit more than 3, was similarly common knowledge. What was not known is that the true value of π, 3.14159265..., is an irrational number, meaning it cannot be expressed as the ratio of two integers.

The words *fiwi* "ring" and *xonwa* "solid disc" were used interchangeably to refer to circles in early [[Xiyeru]] mathematics, later becoming distinguished as the circumference and area of the circle respectively. *nāba-miwi* "complete-turn" was innovated some time in the first few centuries AGS to describe the circle as a geometric object. In the 6th century, [[Inaʼaro Faweʼēyezuravujuweu]] was using this term to refer to the circumference as a measure:
> "Were you to take, and completely wrap around a ring, the thinnest string, the length would be equal to the *nābamiwi* (circumference)"

The earliest and most common approximation of π used by the [[Xiyeru]] was 25/8 (3.125), which is good enough for most practical applications. A common mnemonic attested from the second century expresses this ratio:
> *ʼaja caʼajaha, fiwā udiwā*
> "The elbow bent, both palms wide"

This idiom reminds craftspeople that something with a length of one *ʼaja*, equal to 25 *tiži* in the [[Xiyeru units of measurement|traditional measurement system]], can be bent into a ring with a diameter of two *tiwā*, equalling 8 *tiži*, giving the 3.125 ratio which can be extrapolated to any circle.

A closer approximation, 22/7 (~3.1429), was known by [[Inaʼaro Faweʼēyezuravujuweu|Inaʼaro's]] time, with no clear origin. In a letter to [[Huxŭkală|Huxŭkală's]] ancestor dated to c. 650 AGS, he emphasises the importance of the oft neglected seventh in approximating these tricky numbers:
> "A little bit smaller is the square's diagonal [√2] than 10 sevenths, and the circle's circumference [π] than 22 sevenths"

In fact, [[Inaʼaro Faweʼēyezuravujuweu]] was the first to prove that π is strictly less than 22/7, though he did not recognise its irrationality. Immediately following from the last passage, he writes:
> "These small differences equal a tenth of the seventh and a one hundredth of the seventh"

before explaining, at great length, a method which he incorrectly believed proved these rational values were exactly correct. They are at least the closest approximations calculated at this point in history: 99/70 (~1.41429) for √2 and 2199/700 (~3.14143) for π, both correct to about 0.005% or 1 part in 20,000.

[[Huxŭkală]] believed that π could not be rationally expressed, but was unable to prove it. She did, however, discover and prove a value twice as close to π as [[Inaʼaro Faweʼēyezuravujuweu|Inaʼaro's]] best: 377/120 (~3.14167), known to her students by 830 AGS. Although never explicitly stated, the fact that 377 is a Fibonacci number is probably no coincidence in her discovery of this approximation.

By the [[11th century]], 22/7 had made its way into the [[Lavondu]] public consciousness, as demonstrated by a text on the common construction of containers of various shapes:
> "Considering barrels of equal length and width, 11 square can fill 14 circular"
implying π ≈ 4×11/14 = 22/7.

However, 25/8 remained the most common approximation, and the very same text makes use of it elsewhere:
> "A [[lífel]]-wide ring can be bent from a rod of 50 [[díji]]"

implying π ≈ 50/16 = 25/8.

[[Inaʼaro Faweʼēyezuravujuweu|Inaʼaro's]] misguided claims that π = 2199/700 and √2 = 99/70 mathematically imply that π = 3 + ⅒√2, an idea that stuck around for quite some time after √2 was proven irrational, and certainly much longer than all his business with sevenths. The following statement is made with conviction in a widespread [[Möxali]] treatise on circles in the [[16th century]]:
> "The difference of the ratio to three is equal to the length of that square whose area contains the fiftieth part of the unitary square"
i.e. π = 3 + √(1/50) = 3 + ⅒√2.
