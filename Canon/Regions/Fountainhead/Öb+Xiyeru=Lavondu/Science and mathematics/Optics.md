# The first spherical lenses
In the [[14th century]] [[Universal calendar|AGS]], a [[Lavondu]] natural philosopher working from the [[Udovuʼo]] island of [[Kigipwa]] developed what may have been the earliest manufactured glass lenses in the world after travelling with [[Xiyeru]] sailors to distant islands further north. These islands had been known by the [[Xiyeru]] for generations even before the existence of the [[Lavondu]], but are mostly small atolls which don't really support extended human presence, and as such have never been settled. This is an excerpt from a series of letters contained within a package of various goods accumulated on the voyage, sent to a prominent political figure in [[T'ugü]].

> On the third night at sea, a large squid was caught, which they called a "seeing-squid". It was brightly coloured, unlike the type that is caught near the shore, and tasted unpleasant. They showed me how the lens [*tiyon* lit. "sphere"] of the eye can be carefully removed with a small knife, and gave it to me to hold in my hand. It was unexpectedly hard and smooth, with a glassy texture almost like obsidian, and kept its form when removed from the socket. I was told no other animal has such an eye.
> 
> They instructed me to look through the lens, which I was astonished to see was clearer than the highest quality glass. The entire horizon was captured within the orb, with the sea above and the sky below. That which lay in the centre was seen with the greatest clarity. Bringing it closer to my own eye, the reflection held in the lens was brought many times closer still, so that distant objects appeared to hang in front of my face. The one who gave me the lens took it back and used it to study clouds on the horizon, claiming they had identified a distant island which was not visible otherwise, and which would not become visible on our journey. By shrinking the horizon in this way, they are able to travel greater distances with greater certainty.
> 
> I asked if the lens could be used to observe the stars, but I was told it was not possible at sea, nor was it possible to bring the lens to shore. They told me that it must be preserved in a vessel of sea water, and that it would only last another day before degrading. Several more seeing-squids were caught on our journey, and each one had the lenses removed from both eyes to aid our navigation. They reasoned that the squids make similar great voyages, and this is why they must see the entire world with such clarity.
> 
> Almost one month had passed when we returned to the city of [[Kiñava]], where I spent one day and one night. I sampled the local fruit and other food in the market square, but was most taken with a brilliant glass bottle, filled with water, which shone like quartz in the sun. It had the shape of an orb at the bottom which concentrated the sun's light into a bright spot, bringing to mind the eye of the seeing squid. The sailors had warned me not to look at the sun through the lens, since it could start fires this way, and I have seen similar demonstrations with pieces of glass. The merchant would not sell me the bottle, but assured me it had come from [[Hagoraras]], another city on the island apparently known for its glassware. I set out for [[Hagoraras]] the next morning, arriving five days later.
> 
> In [[Hagoraras]] I contacted six glassworkers, asking each to produce five identical glass spheres to my specifications. Only one was able to produce an adequate set of lenses, one of which I have included in this package for your examination. They are not immaculate like the eye of the seeing-squid and as such are not of any particular use, but demonstrate the phenomenon described well enough. The glassworker explained to me that the glass was made so clear by the use of white sand found only at the mouth of the [[Saʼi river]], and that the surface of the orbs were made so smooth by washing them in the stomach juices of some monstrous bird which I have not seen. I did not fully understand the process as they described it to me, so they offered me a sheet of notes which I have also enclosed in this package, but which I must admit I cannot read.

# Víxkújdananca vurin
**Víxkújdananca vurin** "theory of light radiation" (*víxkújdanan* for short) was a theory of light, vision and geometric optics originally developed by [[Kíbik Fatininmaqúndu]] and further elaborated by her students in the [[16th century]]. It was one of the most widely proliferated **vurin** "theories" from the [[Lavondu science|Lavondu scientific canon]] which flourished throughout the second millennium, being eventually incorporated in some form into the natural philosophies of many cultures throughout Fountainhead.

Older Xiyeru ideas about the nature of light considered it to be an **[[rhaza|ūžāraza]]**, a fundamental substance which was involved in the formation and manifestation of many **[[rhaza|ʼawaraza]]**, complex substances. Some **[[rhaza|ūžāraza]]**, such as **ūmu** "water" and **rhida** "light" were visible, while others like **ava** "air" and **rhovā** "spirit" were invisible. [[Kíbik Fatininmaqúndu|Kíbik]] posited that light was not a substance, but a phenomenon produced by the interaction of visible and invisible substances, comparing it to visible objects blown by the invisible wind.

[[Kíbik Fatininmaqúndu|Kíbik's]] reasoning stemmed from her observation of the geometrical nature of light as rays, likely the first person in the world to rigorously do so. She deduced that if light itself were visible, then the rays themselves should be visible in clear air, but instead it is observed that only objects which light falls on become visible. [[Kíbik Fatininmaqúndu|Kíbik]] went as far as to suggest that light did not intrinsically exist in the world, but was purely the manifestation of vision.

[[Lavondu science|Lavondu natural philosophy]] is based on a set of five tenets or principles forming something somewhat resembling the scientific method. One of these tenets is to never discard existing knowledge and treat the total pool of all knowledge as a fluid thing which is constantly updated. Past theories and observations are correct given the knowledge that existed at the time, and can be reinterpreted by new ideas. [[Kíbik Fatininmaqúndu|Kíbik's]] *víxkújdanan* adheres to this principle as follows:
 - A new type of invisible substance is introduced, **kújdanadnin** "ray". Rays are described as **svínda vílin** "uncountable rods", which are **kúj-dana** "outwardly-drawn" equally in all directions from their source.
 - The traditional [[Xiyeru]] visible substance *rhida* "light", called **lída** in [[Möxali]], is reinterpreted as a process which produces **lidaja kújdanadnin** "light-rays". Things like the sun and fire are sources of light-rays, but may themselves be made up of different substances, since there is no such thing as "light" as a physical substance.
 - "Visible" substances are those which interact with light-rays, changing their colour and direction for example, while "invisible" substances like air allow the rays to pass through without interaction. Translucent substances like water must therefore actually be mixtures of visible and invisible fundamental substances.
 - Another similar invisible substance, **inija kújdanadnin** "eye-rays", is produced inside the eye and similarly radiated out.
 - Vision occurs when an eye-ray meets a light-ray head-on and interacts, creating a **paklíxtin** "little flash" or **lísen** "point of light". The formation of many *lísen* creates a **vitunöx** "complex image".

[[Kíbik Fatininmaqúndu|Kíbik's]] model of light is not completely accurate, but does provide the functional basics of geometrical optics, such as:
 - Why objects at a greater distance appear smaller and dimmer.
 - The fact that light travels along the shortest path from source to observer
 - A simplified version of the law of refraction. 
 - Why any object at a great enough distance appears as a single point without form, since only a single ray connection occurs.
This last point naturally also implies that some objects are so small or distant that no connection is achieved, so perhaps all "invisible" substances are in fact made up of objects which are too small to be seen.

Of course [[Kíbik Fatininmaqúndu|Kíbik's]] main interest and motivation for developing the theory was spherical lenses, for which she was posthumously named *Fatininmaqúndu* "who beholds spheres". [[Kíbik Fatininmaqúndu|Kíbik]] (incorrectly) considered a sphere of water to be the ideal lens, believing that such a construction would emulate the eye's ability to capture images by fostering the interaction of eye-rays and light-rays. She dedicated her later life to refining methods of glasswork to produce large hollow orbs which could be filled with water and used as lenses, both to aid astronomical observation and to study the optical properties of the lenses themselves. This culminated in the construction of a [[Kíbik Fatininmaqúndu#Kíbik's telescope|massive proto-telescope]] in the 1540s [[Universal calendar|AGS]], which I will write about another time.

[[Kíbik Fatininmaqúndu|Kíbik]] speculated a small amount on the implications of *víxkújdanan*, which were explored more thoroughly by her students and successors after her time. She believed that stars were likely large objects with form and structure, but which are too distant to resolve, and compared this to the sun which she believed to be much closer, but did not explicitly claim that the sun was just another star. She also drew comparisons between the spherical water lens and the nature of the planet, which was known to be spherical and was said to have begun as an empty ocean. For a time, there were many proponents of a theory that suggested that all the land and life in the world was merely a virtual image projected by the observation of the great eye (the [[Moons of Winter|two moons]]) looking through the spherical lens of the ocean at the true physical world, which was located elsewhere, though it seems this idea may not have come from [[Kíbik Fatininmaqúndu|Kíbik]] directly.

The diagram below (measuring around 30cm x 15cm) is one of many drawn by [[Kíbik Fatininmaqúndu|Kíbik]] and attached to letters sent to her peers, sponsors and other interested parties. It illustrates the operation of a spherical lens magnifying an image of a distant ship when the observer is at a certain position. [[Kíbik Fatininmaqúndu|Kíbik]] called this process **tininiyanjínen** "holding within the sphere", believing that the image of the ship is created inside the lens itself where the eye-rays and light-rays are in conjunction. Though physically smaller than the actual ship, the image is formed under a greater angle to the observer than the unmagnified ship and so appears larger. The greenish hue of the paper is characteristic of high quality paper made from the bark of the [[aroidi tree]] endemic to [[Udovuʼo]]. As is typical for letters of the period, it is dated with an abbreviated numerical date [1 • 2 • 7 • 3], short for 1st [[Ujnö]], 2nd [[Zívon]] ([[Danon]]), 7th [[Bigídne]] ([[Qílin]]), 3rd day ([[Sipö]]), and stamped [57] to mark the 57th [[Öcídñox|calendrical cycle of the period]]. This works out to some day in 1532 [[Universal calendar|AGS]].
