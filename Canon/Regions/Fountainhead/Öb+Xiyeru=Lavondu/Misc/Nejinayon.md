***Nejinayon*** ([[Möxali]]) or *fanaʼayo mūʼoyo* ([[Xiri]]) is the ritual recital of [[Xiyeru]] lore. It was traditionally an oral tradition of storytelling, but since the [[Savamāri|invention of writing]] in the mid first millennium BGS, it has also included the transcription of lore and reproduction of historical almanacs.

# Etymology

The traditional [[Xiri]] term *fanaʼayo muʼoyo* can be glossed as `ACT-speak-CONT past-ACC`, meaning literally "continually speaking the past".

# Prehistory

The earliest knowledge passed down by Nejinayon almost certainly predates the first arrival of the ancestors of the [[Xiyeru]] in [[Udovuʼo]], thought to have taken place around 2000 BGS. Much of the information passed down before the development of writing became corrupted, confused or completely lost as traditions varied from place to place. A significant area of lost knowledge is that of the world beyond [[Udovuʼo]], which became so mystified as to be indistinguishable from legends telling of the [[Xiyeru creation story|creation of the universe and first people]]. For example, it is believed that the ancestral [[Xiyeru]] may have had [[Exploration of Cqa|knowledge of Cqa]], but by the time of the first written records this had become corrupted into conflicting local folklores about people descending from [[Āžuvuwirō|dark clouds to the west or south]].

# Lavondu restoration

In the [[9th century]] AGS, [[Möxali]]-speaking [[Xiyeru]] communities in [[T'ugü]] undertook a vast project of cultural preservation, reformation and reorganisation known as [[Tuvöblin]], commonly taken to be the beginning of the [[Lavondu]] culture. This period of history is also known as the **Lavondu restoration**, as it involved the reinstitution and standardisation of several important [[Xiyeru]] cultural traditions which had diminished throughout the [[Exodus period]].

One important step of this process was the formal definition of a [[Öcídñox|generalised astronomical calendar]] and the subsequent chronolisation of historical records. The previous ~1400 years of written [[Xiyeru]] history did not record actual dates, but detailed calendrical information nonetheless. This allowed contemporary [[Xiyeru]] scholars to calculate specific dates for major events and calibrate the chronology. The entirety of the known history of the world was arranged into discrete eras, each named for an important establishing event. The complete, assembled history covers several millennia and includes many eras which are internally structured, but unable to be definitely positioned with respect to the others.
