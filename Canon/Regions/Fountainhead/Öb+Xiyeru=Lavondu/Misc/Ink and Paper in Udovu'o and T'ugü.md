In the [[4th century]], methods of manufacturing writing ink and paper were developed simultaneously in [[Udovuʼo]]. The paper was made from the fibrous, peeling bark of the *ārōidi* tree which is endemic to [[Udovuʼo]], while the ink was a derivative of the [[Xiyeru|Xiyeru's]] traditional [[Ńaʼay|tattoo]] ink, with the addition of a rice-based glue which helps the pigment to bind to the paper.
# Ink
[[Xiyeru]] writing ink was made from two pre-existing, commonly used substances. The first is a glue made from black glutinous rice called *ēnēram* "rice-glue". It was made by over-boiling unmilled rice and constantly stirring it into a homogeneous purple goop. Yam wine ([[Xiri]] *warań*) was added and the mixture was left to ferment for three days. This greatly enriches the colour and separates the solution into a sticky purple liquid, and some lumpy frothy stuff which is removed. It was then boiled down again to thicken it into tar-like consistency.

The second ingredient is *ijižau*, the [[Xiyeru|Xiyeru's]] [[Ńaʼay|tattoo]] ink. This is a mixture of black pigment made from *ijidef* (charred pig bones) and the sweet water of the *pyāʼe*, the fruit of a kind of palm tree. Ijižau alone does not bind well to paper, and ēnēram fades to a yellowish colour over time, but the mixture of these substances is an excellent black ink called *ēnījižau*, or *iníjo* in Möxali. The ink is dried out into a solid block so that it can be stored and transported easily, then water can be added to return it to usable ink.
# Paper
The [[Xiyeru]] made their paper from the bark of the *ārōidi*, a banyan-like tree endemic to [[Udovuʼo]] which grows only in the volcanic soil at around 500m above sea level. The preservation of the ārōidi was recognised as important within the [[Xiyeru]] cultural, so bark was generally only taken if it was already peeling from the tree's trunk-like aerial roots. The bark, called *caʼetwa* or *caʼewda*, was repeatedly boiled, beaten flat and dried in the sun to yield a brittle paper with a natural greenish colour. The [[Xiyeru]] called this paper *fazūjebe*, meaning "beaten bark/skin". Paper was typically produced in long sheets and folded up into a book called a *fayāwajebe*, which can be cut into individual sheets of paper called *wayah*, or used as a single manuscript to transcribe longer texts.

The manufacture of paper of this kind was a laborious process which could only take place in [[Udovuʼo]], and so it was of great value to the emergent trade economy in T'ugü. Other regions under [[Xiyeru]] influence, particularly [[T'ugü]], made attempts at developing paper from other similar trees, but it was always of a lower quality and imported paper was generally preferred by the elite. From the [[5th century]] onward, paper became a major export from [[Udovuʼo]] and its trade granted economic support to the islanders after the plague and famine of the [[Exodus period]].

Fazújebe, called *zújbe* in [[Möxali]], developed into an artistic medium in its own right in [[T'ugü]] beginning in the [[9th century]]. It was dyed in bright colours and used to compose geometric artwork, as a less time-consuming but more expensive alternative to traditional [[Öb#Textiles|woven art]]. [[Öb]] craftsmanship also lent itself to the development of more advanced methods of creating manuscripts. The paper itself was naturally brittle and easily wore at the edges, so imported blank paper books were often pulped and reformed over an internal mesh of fine linen thread to extend the paper's lifespan. For particularly important manuscripts, paper pulp was plastered over a frame made by gluing together wood and wafer-thin bamboo strips using tree sap or rice glue. These framed sheets, which are about 5mm thick, were called *akídvayaq* in [[Möxali]], meaning "strengthened-sheet". They were then decorated and strung together to form a folded book like the original [[Xiyeru]] fayāwajebe, which in [[Möxali]] was called a *yabdonlon*.
