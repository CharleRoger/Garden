The **Xiyeru Confederation** was an oligarchic confederation of states operating in each of the five islands of [[Udovuʼo]] from the [[8th century|8th]] to [[13th century|13th]] centuries, and in its later years assuming total or partial political control over [[T'ugü]] and parts of [[Irimri]] and [[Qnōp']]. It was the first unified [[Xiyeru]] state in [[Udovuʼo]].
# Name
In [[Ahōtoli]], the state was officially called *Tohoulŭ Kīlukī*, roughly meaning "Five Homelands of the [[Xiyeru]]". The word *kīlu*, cognate to *[[Xiyeru]]*, had originally meant any person native to [[Udovuʼo]], but came to mean a citizen of the Xiyeru Confederation, thus the populace was also known by the collective noun *kīlukwa*, meaning "citizenry" or "the public". Official documents written in the [[Möxali]] language called the state *Udvúqca Xerúja ni-Siba* "The [[Xiyeru]] Assembly of [[Udovuʼo]]".

The state was more commonly and universally referred to synecdochically by the name of the island where the government was based, [[Azodo]]; *[[Ahōto]]* in its native language [[Ahōtoli]] and *(v-)Azudo* in [[Möxali]].
# Structure
The five main islands of [[Udovuʼo]] constituted one of the original states of the Xiyeru Confederation. Each was governed by an assembly of [[Cacadiži|ministers]] led by a [[Āʼiyoru|governor]], and the confederation as a whole had a [[Azodo Government#General assembly|general assembly]] with certain universal powers. The [[Azodo Government#Origin and structure|ministerial assemblies]] acted as legislative bodies, while the [[Āʼiyoru|governors]] held most of the executive power, and a separate [[Fayādayāmi|judicial branch]] had the power to interpret the law code and hold all citizens of the confederation to account. This arrangement was known as the [[Azodo Government]], as the general assembly first sat in the city of [[Mamadezirova]] on the island of [[Azodo]].

Later in history, other states with different internal political structures joined the Xiyeru Confederation in a subordinate role, most notably the early [[Lavondu Commonwealth]].
# History
## Isolationist period (700 - 1042)
The island of [[Azodo]] was historically more culturally isolated from the other four main islands of Udovuʼo, and this cultural heritage was extended into the policy of the government. For over a century, almost all trade with T'ugü ceased. It was not until the installation of [[Koxĭya Ahoukēholuʼŭihă|Koxĭya Eʼōene]] as the first (and only) [[Āʼiyoru|governor]] of the [[Rhavo todo]] in the [[9th century]] that the trade routes of old were properly restored, though the confederation's strictly enforced commercial regulations severely limited the volume of commerce to a small fraction of mid-[[7th century]] levels for another 200 years.

The proliferation of [[Lavondu]] culture and the [[Möxali]] language which characterised the [[Thousand rivers period]] notably did not take hold in [[Udovuʼo]] until much later due to [[Azodo]] isolationism. However, many important [[Lavondu]] politicians maintained relationships with the elite [[Nīholu]] nobility during this time and some were able to relocate to the [[Udovuʼo|home islands]], though they were not considered [[Nīholu]] and the confederation's law code generally prohibited immigration for the common populace.
### Formation
The confederation was formed in response to the events of the [[Exodus period]], which saw [[Udovuʼo]] partially depopulated by famine and refugee emigration and a subsequent political power vacuum.

According to contemporary records, the [[Azodo Government|government]] first sat on a winter solstice on which both the moons of Winter were full and in conjunction, which was the first day of either 700 or 701 AGS depending on how you count it. The alignment of these astronomical events, called a [[great syzygy]], is extremely rare, having notably only happened previously on the first day of [[Universal calendar#Year counting|year 0]].
### International interaction
Though it remained generally isolationist for over three centuries, the confederation did have some interactions with other peoples of the world during this period. The most notable example of this is the [[Azodo Government|Azodo Government's]] attempt to absorb the [[Xiyeru]]-descendant [[Lavondu]] people. The official stance was that they were still [[Xiyeru]], thus were the responsibility of the state just as the inhabitants of [[Udovuʼo]] were.

In 844, the government opted to install a trade minister, [[Koxĭya Ahoukēholuʼŭihă]], as the first governor of the [[Rhavo todo|foreign villages]], with the intention of establishing a governable political structure in [[T'ugü]]. [[Koxĭya Ahoukēholuʼŭihă|Koxĭya]] did bring politics to [[T'ugü]] with her [[Tuvöblin]] project, but allowed the population to remain an independent, ungoverned, communistic pseudo-state, before relinquishing her rulership after 17 years in the role.

For a time, it seemed as though [[Koxĭya Ahoukēholuʼŭihă|Koxĭya]] might be prosecuted for acting against her duty to the state, but her contemporary governor of [[Azodo]], the popular and benevolent [[Kōlăcetĭ]], argued in her favour to the supreme judiciary. He reasoned that the constitution of the confederation simply had not established a precedent for the treatment of [[Xiyeru]] emigrants, and that the state's official policy of isolationism should have prevented them from interfering with what must be considered a foreign people in a foreign land.

The [[Lavondu]] flourished after [[Tuvöblin]] and their official independence, and in the following centuries experienced a surge in international interaction throughout western [[Fountainhead]], though the Xiyeru Confederation remained mostly excluded. It was not until the mid-[[10th century]] that the state began to form relationships with other polities, most notably the [[Ansang Empire]] via a series of gift exchanges and diplomatic missions starting around 950.

The first half of the [[10th century]] also saw the [[Xiyeru]] begin to reconnect to [[Cqa]], at first vicariously through [[Exploration of Cqa|Lavondu voyages]] which rediscovered the navigable route accidentally, then later more deliberately by the explorer [[Hōyecă Tŭlihoeʼōikwă]], who visited the floating islands many times between 925 and 946 and established communication with the [[Maicqa]].
### Electoral reform
A succession crisis lasting 986 – 990 almost ended the Xiyeru Confederation, when the dissatisfied populace of the far north island [[Kigipwa]] boycotted the rule of the [[Azodo Government]] by voting out three successive [[Āʼiyoru|governors]] and planning the same for a fourth, each after serving only one term of [[Újnö|384 days]]. A [[Āʼiyoru|governor]] would typically serve several terms, without limit, before the [[Nīholu]] caste would choose to hold an election for a change in leadership. The [[Azodo Government|government]] responded with a twofold amendment to the unwritten constitution of the Xiyeru Confederation:
1. A [[Āʼiyoru|gubernatorial]] election must be held on all [[Udovuʼo|five islands]] at least every cycle of four terms (actually [[Öcídñox|1540 days]], around 6 years), regardless of how many terms the sitting [[Āʼiyoru|governors]] had actually served. By convention, this election was held on the [[Öcídñox#Savon|savon]], a four-day intercalary period between each cycle of the newly adopted [[Öcídñox]] calendar. This was known as *Sēnĭ Kōlăcetĭkī* "[[Kōlăcetĭ|Kōlăcetĭ's]] law", since [[Kōlăcetĭ]] had famously abdicated after his fourth term and supported such a limit for all [[Āʼiyoru|governors]] over a century prior, though the eventual law did not prevent indefinite re-election.
2. [[Cacadiži|Ministers]] may vote to veto the result of their island's optional [[Āʼiyoru|gubernatorial]] recall election which may take place every term, [[Újnö|384 days]], but not the result of the four-termly mandatory election.

Since the [[Cacadiži|ministers]] were carefully appointed by the governors themselves in order to maximise their support, these amendments made it next to impossible for a [[Āʼiyoru|governor]] to be voted out of office except at the end of the [[Öcídñox|1540-day cycle]], though there was no limit to the number of cycles that could be served.
## Cetănehă dynasty (1024-1192)
[[Cetănehă]] was the [[Āʼiyoru|governor]] of [[Azodo]] when the [[Azodo Government#Origin and structure|general assembly]] of the [[Azodo Government]] first formed c. 700 AGS, and is often considered primarily responsible for its creation. The last [[Azodo]] [[Āʼiyoru|governor]] who was guaranteed to inherit the role was [[Yawăyawă]], [[Cetănehă|Cetănehă's]] great great grandson, who took office in 845.

Though patrilineal inheritance had ended, [[Cetănehă|Cetănehă's]] descendants, who had spread throughout the [[Udovuʼo|home islands]] proudly wearing the familial moniker *Cetănehăkī*, remained important to [[Azodo Government|Azodo politics]] and appeared as [[Cacadiži|ministers]] and occasionally [[Āʼiyoru|governors]] a few more times over the next couple of centuries.

In 1042, a collusion of [[Cetănehă|Cetănehăkī]] cousins won four of the five island [[Āʼiyoru|gubernatorial]] elections, barring only that of [[Kigipwa]], giving a single family the vast majority of political power in [[Udovuʼo]]. The [[Āʼiyoru|governor]] of [[Huzaw]] in particular actually was a male-line descendant of [[Cetănehă]], which essentially won him his seat for free. Though any one of them could have been replaced at the end of every ~6-year term in office, their popularity kept them in power for multiple election cycles, and they were often replaced by other members of the house of [[Cetănehă]].
### Economic growth
A trade boom in the early [[11th century]] bolstered the economy of [[T'ugü]] and other societies connected to the maritime trade network, including [[Qnōp']] and [[Krobu]]. The Xiyeru Confederation, however, initially saw comparatively little growth, shielded from potential prosperity by its own regulations. Interest in economic expansion began to emerge among the elite [[Nīholu]] class, particularly in the [[Cetănehă|Cetănehăkī]] family and a small handful of other noble families who had also achieved significant political power in the history of the confederation thus far.

Through many gradual agreements with [[Lavondu]] political leaders, often underhand, the [[Nīholu|Xiyeru aristocracy]] began extracting an ever-growing tax from the stateless gift economy of [[T'ugü]] via the [[Zúnton|Zúnton system]]. [[Lavondu]] records from the period call this process *golunja ulzin* "apologetic commitment", a reference to the older act of *gulon* "apology", in which [[Lavondu]] communities would pay tribute to the [[Xiyeru]] leaders in [[Udovuʼo]] in the wake of the [[Exodus period#The Great Hunger (656 - 664 AGS)|Great Hunger]]. Though not an official state taxation, the [[Azodo Government]] deemed such asymmetrical "gift" arrangements lawful on the grounds that the original gulon, which had ended around two centuries prior, represented a debt only partially paid.

Golunja ulzin allowed the growing Xiyeru Confederation to profit from the maritime trade network without direct involvement, though throughout the [[12th century]] cities in [[Udovuʼo]] began to form trade relationships with their counterparts in [[Ansang Islands|Ansang]], as well as some [[Maicqa trade unions]]. This was the first major step in the Xiyeru Confederation's gradual shift away from isolationism, though they remained officially isolationist throughout the [[Cetănehă]] dynasty. Goods from all around the [[Fountainhead]] coast trickled into the [[Udovuʼo|home islands]], as well as [[plink]] and [[woodsnot]] derivatives from [[Cqa]]. The islands of [[Udovuʼo]] have very limited bands of liveable and exploitable land around their volcanoes, so the growing economy of their rapidly urbanising society came to depend on the import of rice, wood and quarried stone from [[T'ugü]] and [[Irimri]] ([[cimcim]] remained an acquired taste).
### Piracy and the Blacksharks
With increased trade volume came an even greater increase in maritime piracy, which became particularly pronounced in the years c. 1050-1150. Pirates commonly originated from [[T'ugü]], [[Irimri]] and particularly [[Qnōp']], where goods flowing in or out of [[Ansang Islands|Ansang]] could easily be reappropriated and taken upstream to be sold in [[Nambō]] cities.

In 1131, the [[Azodo Government]] established an anti-piracy law-enforcement organisation, officially called *[[Blacksharks|Aʼutaē Kisēnĭkī]]* "Powerful Action of Just Law", but more commonly known as *Īcĭʼălo* "[[Blacksharks]]", due to the black cloaks of the higher ranking officers. The [[Blacksharks]] would guard important ports in [[Udovuʼo]] and survey common shipping routes, and could be dispatched to target specific incidents at sea. Through the [[12th century|12th]] and especially [[13th century|13th]] centuries, the [[Blacksharks]] became the arbiters of much of the diplomacy with other states like the [[Lavondu Commonwealth]] and [[Ansang Empire]].

The first *Ecăcikĭ Aʼutaēkī* "Minister of Powerful Action" to be placed in charge of the fleet was [[Hehăkē]], connected to the noble house of [[Cetănehă]] by marriage. [[Hehăkē]] remained in the role for 17 years until his death in 1148 and is credited with quelling the age of piracy almost completely. The [[Blacksharks]] continued to patrol the seas for over a century thereafter.
### Economic crisis and annexation of T'ugü
The pirate crisis is associated with the first of many economic failures and military conflicts occurring throughout certain societies connected to the maritime trade network in the [[11th century]], [[12th century|12th]] and [[13th century|13th]] centuries, particularly in [[Qnōp']] and [[Krobu]]. The first large-scale disruption to trade was in 1180, when the first [[Qnōp' rebellion|rebellions in Qnōp']] began, destabilising the economies of many societies over the next decade.

In 1183, certain regions of [[T'ugü]] began to fare particularly badly, as the [[Zúnton|Zúnton system]] failed to handle the scale of economic imbalance and reduced supply of goods. Most of [[T'ugü]] was inhabited by [[cimcim]]-farming [[Öb]], who also produced rice and other crops, a great deal of which was traded downstream and supported the growing [[Lavondu]] population. A decent proportion of the [[Lavondu|Lavondu's]] rice and other grain was also ultimately imported from [[Qnōp']]. As resources became scarce among the [[Lavondu]], riverine trade in [[T'ugü]] diminished, leaving much the population on the verge of societal collapse.

The next year, 1184, the [[Azodo Government]] stepped in to prevent further crisis, primarily to protect the economy of [[Udovuʼo]] which was becoming dependent on [[T'ugü|T'ugü's]] produce. An offer was extended to the political representatives of the [[Lavondu]] *[[díjda]]* "clan~tribe", the largest societal units that could be effectively communicated with:
- The [[Azodo Government]] would establish a council of nominally 50 elected officials, largely existing [[díjda]] leaders, who would govern [[Zúnton]] at the top level, deeming that it had failed to self-organise on the scale of [[T'ugü]] as a whole. This council came to be known as the *[[Tugija Uvísiba]]* "Grand Council of T'ugü".
- The [[díjda]] would be codified into actual polities and extended to encompass the entire population of [[T'ugü]], enforced by the [[Xiyeru]] state if necessary. This included the [[Öb]] population, now over a million, which had already been assimilating into [[Lavondu]] culture for the last few centuries but had not yet been considered part of the [[díjda]].
- The [[Azodo Government#Origin and structure|general assembly]] of [[Azodo]] would hold special executive powers over the [[Tugija Uvísiba|grand council]], similarly to the five [[Azodo Government#Origin and structure|special assemblies]] of the [[Udovuʼo|home islands]], but with a relationship tailored to hook into existing [[T'ugü]] politics, notably lacking a [[Āʼiyoru|governor]].
- [[Zúnton]] would be used to pay a mandatory tax to the confederation, which for many tribes was actually a better deal than the existing "gift" agreements, though still significantly benefited the [[Xiyeru]] state.

This 50-strong [[Tugija Uvísiba|council]] was inspired by the idea that there were 50 [[Lavondu]] [[díjda]] each associated with 50 original ships which carried the first settlers to [[T'ugü]] during the [[Exodus period#The Great Departure (c. 660 - 700/701 AGS)|Great Departure]] of the late [[7th century]]. In actual fact, there were over 100 [[díjda]] composing the [[Lavondu]] population of over 100,000, and many more original ships. The perception of the [[díjda]] varied from place to place, that is until it became a rigorously-defined political entity in [[Azodo Government|Azodo]] law.

Most leaders immediately agreed to these terms; it automatically granted them state-backed power over much larger populations and productive areas of land without conflict, as well as a greater degree of economic security for their new domain. Those who did not initially agree had no choice but to join the confederation shortly after, as neighbouring [[díjda]] could not engage in [[Zúnton]] with them otherwise, leaving them without the support on which they had come to crucially rely.

By 1190, [[T'ugü]] had been entirely absorbed into the Xiyeru Confederation by law, and in the following year a census was completed which defined which centres of population belonged to which [[díjda]]. The arrangement of [[T'ugü]] into a tiered political system, with the [[Tugija Uvísiba|grand council]] and [[díjda]] at the top, was the foundation of what became the [[Lavondu Commonwealth]], a soft-state which eventually operated on a much larger scale and long outlived the Xiyeru Confederation.
## Expansionist period (1192-1290)
The [[12th century]] saw quite a profound shift in the popular politics of the [[Nīholu]] nobility in [[Udovuʼo]], during which time the economy of the [[Udovuʼo|home islands]] once again became inextricably entangled with mainland [[Fountainhead]]. Towards the end of the century, economic growth was increasingly seen as necessary to the continued success of the state, leading many of the most powerful [[Nīholu]] families to invest their communities' wealth in foreign trade and resource acquisition.

The de-facto ruling family, the [[Cetănehă|Cetănehăkī]], were more apprehensive however, and as a result their popularity began to decline during the economic crisis of the 1180s. They were more conservative in their economic activity and preferred to focus on the continued security of their noble house and of the internal economy, which did involve measured operations outside [[Udovuʼo]] like the [[Blacksharks|Blackshark]] anti-piracy force and the annexation of [[T'ugü]]. Many influential families felt that the handling of the latter was unduly prolonged and convoluted, almost to the point of scuppering the massive potential of a stabilised [[T'ugü]] economy, and that the restrictions placed on their new foreign economic partners were far too lax.

Favour gradually shifted away from the [[Cetănehă|Cetănehăkī]], and after the elections of 1186 and the removal of [[Huzaw|Huzaw's]] [[Āʼiyoru|governor]] by the island's [[Cacadiži|ministry]] in 1189, [[Azodo]] was left as the only island run by a [[Cetănehă|Cetănehăkī]]. In 1192, the [[Azodo]] governorship, the most powerful seat in the confederation, was also lost, ending the [[Cetănehă]] dynasty, though they did remain involved in politics for the rest of the confederation's history.

[[Azodo|Azodo's]] new [[Āʼiyoru|governor]] was [[Kwinĭcikĭ]], a member of one of the island's lesser [[Nīholu]] families with big plans for the state. [[Kwinĭcikĭ]] himself was certainly no underdog, however, as he was the 6th minister of the [[Blacksharks]] at the time of his election. No law ever required a [[Āʼiyoru|governor]] to relinquish their [[Cacadiži|ministerial]] roles when entering office, though they usually did, and in this case [[Kwinĭcikĭ]] chose to retain both offices. By his precedent, the [[Azodo]] governorship carried with it direct command of the [[Blacksharks]] from that point on, exacerbating the power of the already dominant position.

[[Kwinĭcikĭ|Kwinĭcikĭ's]] inauguration took place just two years after the annexation of [[T'ugü]] was officially completed and one year after a great census of its population, a sociopolitical context which came to define his 18-year career as [[Azodo]] [[Āʼiyoru|governor]]. One of his first acts was to massively increase production of [[Sailing in Fountainhead#Threesail|threesail ships]] and training of [[Blacksharks|Blackshark]] crews, both of which grew almost tenfold in his first 6-year stint. Around 40 [[Blacksharks|Blackshark]] ships were permanently stationed in [[T'ugü]] under [[Kwinĭcikĭ]], mostly on the coast but also as deep up the river as was possible, which eventually developed into something of a military occupation. [[Udovuʼo]] never had much in the way of ground-based armies, but the sight of a fully archer-laden [[Sailing in Fountainhead#Threesail|threesail]] lording over each and every major trading post on the river of lower [[T'ugü]] was enough to keep the mandated import and export flowing without disruption.

In 1197, as [[Kwinĭcikĭ|Kwinĭcikĭ's]] grand plan was unfolding, the [[Azodo Government]] voted to adopt an official policy of expansionism, in particular the idea that the economy of the state, and really the state itself, should be ever-growing. This was codified as one of the five *[[ʼusēnĭ]]* "principles" or "axioms", literally "first-laws" of the Xiyeru Confederation's unwritten constitution. The [[ʼusēnĭ]] were the pillars that laid the precedent for all other law-making, though they were not constant and did change a few times through history. In this case, the new expansionist [[ʼusēnĭ]] replaced one of the originals which declared that the state existed to serve the wellbeing of [[Udovuʼo]] alone, a rule which had already been bent quite thoroughly for the last few decades.
