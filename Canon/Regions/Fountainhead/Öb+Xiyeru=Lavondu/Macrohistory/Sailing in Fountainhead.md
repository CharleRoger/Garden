The history of **[[Xiyeru]] sailing** began with the development of the sailing ship, thought to have taken place on or near the island of [[Buhō]] c. 2000 BGS. The technology matured in [[Udovuʼo]] and developed further with the spread of the [[Lavondu]] macroculture in the first and second millennium AGS.
# Prehistory
Linguistic connections between [[Udovuʼo]] and other [[Fountainhead]] islands, particularly [[Buhō]], suggest that the ancestors of the [[Xiyeru]] originated in mainland [[Fountainhead]], first arriving in [[Udovuʼo]] in the second millennium BGS. There was a significant loss and mystification of cultural and technological knowledge from the time of settlement of [[Udovuʼo]] until around the middle of the first millennium BGS, when the earliest written form of the [[Nejinayon]] historical tradition began recording contemporary history.
# Types of ship
## Ancient Xiyeru ships
The sailing ships traditionally used by the [[Xiyeru]], and the ones first introduced to the [[Öb]] after contact in the [[1st century]], were double-hulled, plank-built canoes ranging from 5-15m in length. Larger canoes were built to transport goods along the rivers of [[Udovuʼo]] and for ritual purposes, but these were not equipped with sails.

The size of sailing ships was limited by the weight of the sails, which were made of pig hide. Later in history, the [[Xiyeru]] used larger cloth sails made of [[lilaw]], a [[T'ugü]] export, and were able to build much more advanced, massive ships 20-30m long, though the most commonly used ships remained around 10m.

The central deck of a ship could be equipped with a fairly small leafy tent to provide shelter for longer voyages of several days, up to around 1000km. It was likely a larger version of this type of ship which originally brought the ancestors of the [[Xiyeru]] to [[Udovuʼo]].

## Xiyal
The type of ship most commonly used by the inhabitants of [[T'ugü]] in the [[Exodus period|Exodus]]and the [[Thousand Rivers period|Thousand Rivers]] periods was the **xiyal**, which is simply the [[Möxali]] word for a sailing ship, from the [[Xiri]] *xi-hāra* "true/right-ship".

The xiyal was the result of centuries of development from the ancestral design shown above. The asymmetrical hulls are [[Canoes in T'ugü|yabda xilubs]] which are almost completely submerged. The larger [[Canoes in T'ugü|xilub]] supports one giant sail which swings freely from the top of the mast, held in place by several ropes which can be used to adjust the orientation. The shelter is more spacious and durable, using a layer of leaves and a layer of [[lilaw]] to effectively shield from the elements. The shelter might look unbalanced on the outrigger, but it is built almost entirely from lightweight bamboo and is actually lighter (when empty) than the two-ply sail. Ships like this would typically be used by families migrating along the northern coast, fisherman searching for a bit of variety or traders transporting small amounts of valuable luxury goods between [[T'ugü]] and [[Udovuʼo]].

## Threesail
The **threesail** (Ahōtoli *hewŭlilō*, Möxali *níflilo*) was a class of ship developed by the [[Xiyeru]] c. 1100 AGS and used by many cultures for centuries thereafter. Threesails were the first ships built specifically to perform long-distance voyages of more than one 64-day month, with some capable of remaining at sea for over a year. The first threesails may have been constructed at the end of the [[11th century]] in the context of [[Exploration of Cqa|exploration deep into Cqa]] or transporting cargo to and from the [[Ansang Islands]], but they rose to prominence due to their use by the [[Blacksharks]] from the 1130s onwards, particularly their famous flagship, the *[[Tanăhoă]]*.

The key characteristic of a threesail is, naturally, its three massive sails, which are each typically larger than 100m², at the upper limit of what can be handled by human power alone. They are similar in basic design to ancient [[Xiyeru]] ships, only much larger and making use of more advanced construction and sailing techniques. Threesails are much heavier-built than the single-sailed, asymmetrical, lightweight bamboo crafts which were popularly used by the Lavondu in the period, whose design can be considered part of a parallel lineage to that which developed into the threesail.

Threesails were also the first ships to make significant use of rowing power. Traditional ships often had one or two large oars acting as rudders, and as larger and larger ships were built, these oars were repurposed for propulsion, multiplied, and built into the sides of the hulls.
