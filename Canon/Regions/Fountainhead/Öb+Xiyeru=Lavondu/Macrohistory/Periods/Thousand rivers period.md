The **Thousand Rivers period** ([[Möxali]] *oríxayija nayam*) was the fourth canonical period of [[Nejinayon]], lasting from 861 to 1184 AGS. This period follows the [[Exodus period]] and precedes the [[Shining light period]].
# Name
*Oríxaye* "thousand rivers" was a [[Möxali]] term coined in the [[9th century]] to refer to the uncountable threads which accumulate into the entire cultural history of the world. Even a thousand rivers (or indeed 2,500, which is what *orí-* actually means) can be understood as converging branches of one greater river which eventually flows into the sea of collective knowledge and culture. This is a reference to the [[Xiyeru]] world view, which understands history as an infinite set of branching trajectories and also uses the river as a metaphor for ancestral knowledge.
# History
The Thousand Rivers period was characterised by the spread of culture and language from [[T'ugü]] throughout western [[Fountainhead]], notably resulting in a significant Outer [[Möxali]]-speaking population of [[Lavondu]] on one of the [[Ansang Islands]]. It was also a period of conflict, leading to the eventual collapse of the [[Ansang Empire]] and significant technological and social progress.
