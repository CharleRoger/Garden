The earliest period discussed in written [[Nejinayon|Xiyeru historical record]] is the **Sunrise period** ([[Möxali]] *ubzíja nayam*), lasting from 729 BGS until 67 AGS and preceding the [[Horizon period]].

The start and end dates of this period are the traditionally accepted dates of the [[Savamāri|invention of writing]] and the discovery of [[T'ugü]] and first contact with the [[Öb]] respectively, which are approximately historically accurate, though it is hard to definitively pinpoint exact dates to these events.
# History
This era's history is mostly biographies of the fifteen [[Āeruweʼa]] who served during this time. It was also augmented with knowledge of [[T'ugü]], so there is some retrospective commentary of the life of the [[Öb]] pre-contact. In particular, the cultural significance of [[cimcim]] and the separation of [[Öb]] into the agricultural lowlanders and semi-nomadic highlanders are described.
# Languages
During this period, [[Xiri]] developed from [[Proto-Xiri language|Proto-Xiri]] and the [[Proto-Öbic language]] split into its two major dialects, [[High Alöbi]] and [[Low Alöbi]].
