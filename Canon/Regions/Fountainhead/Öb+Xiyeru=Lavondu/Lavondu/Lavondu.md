## Parts of the self
The Lavondu settled on a [[Xiyeru]]-like system as a continuation of [[Xiyeru#Parts of the self|Eru]], which incorporated features of [[Öb#Yaloc|Yaloc]]. The [[Xiyeru]] word *Seweru* continued into Möxali as **Sviru** or Svidu, though it now described five parts of the self rather than the traditional three. Folk etymology connected this word with the homophonous verb *sviru* "find, reveal", though they are actually unrelated, the latter coming from [[Xiri]] *sa-verō* "un-cover".

The *Sviru* combines traditional [[Xiyeru]] ideas about cyclic dependency and successive nesting with newer [[Öb|Öbic]] concepts about the relationships between the parts.
1. **Dítö** — The body, considered to be an inert mass, were it not for the lower-level components.
2. **Cílon** — The blood, contained within the body. Acts as a medium to distribute the Yaloj throughout the body in order to bring it to life.
3. **Yaloj** — The non-physical part, infused into the blood. Yaloj is considered a real but intangible substance or structure, which plays different roles depending on the part of the body it inhabits. In most of the external body, the Yaloj manifests motor function and sensitivity, while internal organs each play a different role. Yaloj can leave the body via blood, and is replenished by the liver, which has the highest concentration of Yaloj and is home to emotion, memories and most other subconscious function. Yaloj is, in both name and concept, a continuation of the [[Öb|Öbic]] belief in *[[Öb#Yaloc|Yaloc]]*
4. **Neden** — The mind, a concentration of Yaloj in the brain. The Neden is responsible for conscious thought and "upper-management" of the various Yaloj areas. It is understood through Xiyeru medicine that a lack of blood to the brain immediately inhibits the ability of all other parts of the body, and results in death at the extreme. This is interpreted as a deficit in the required Yaloj forming the Neden, leaving it unable to govern the local specialisation of the Yaloj in the different parts of the body. This makes the Neden the only fundamental, indispensable part of the Yaloj.
5. **Lúva** — The spirit, a completely incognisable thing deep within the mind, responsible for the existence of consciousness and life itself. Unlike the other non-physical parts, the Lúva is truly formless and has no physical location. It is not strictly part of the Yaloj, but something even further abstracted which interfaces with the Yaloj via the Neden. It is considered fact that such a thing must exist, yet cannot possibly ever be known. In some sense, it is the most real part of the self, since it is the only part which actually distinguishes the self from the rest of the universe.

![[sviru poem bracelet.png]]
An [[11th century]] ceremonial wooden bracelet, on which is inscribed the following 25-mora cyclic poem about the nature of the five Sviru:
> `... MI ZE ÑU DA (SA) GA LA ÑU DA (SA) DI JE ÑU DA (SA) YA ZA ÑU DA (SA) VO JA ÑU DA (SA) ...`
> [...mɪz̪ˈɲu.ɾɑ θɑ ɴɑl̪ˈɲu.ɾɑ θɑ d̪ᶻɪʒˈɲu.ɾɑ θɑ jɑðˈɲu.ɾɑ θɑ vɔʒˈɲu.ɾɑ θɑ...]
> *...mizñúda sa galñúda sa dijñúda sa yazñúda sa vojñúda sa...*
> "...to be cognised, but not to be felt, but not to be touched, but not to be seen, but not to be authenticated, but not..."

This poem is based on the five **vílen** "values, measures" which characterise the physicality of each Sviru. Each pair of vílen forms a phrase describing one of the Sviru, e.g. *...yazñúda sa vojñúda...* "...to be seen, but not to be authenticated..." describes the body. It is the only part of the self which is plainly visible, the verb root *yad-* in *yazñúda* means "make evident" or "present" rather than just "see", the blood can also be seen but is not so immediately evident. The verb root *vuj-* in *vojñúda* describes knowledge that a thing is true, genuine or alive, characterising the body as fabricated and not an intrinsically living being ("authenticated" is not a great translation). The Lúva, in contrast, is the most genuine and true self, despite being innately incomprehensible, and so the poem loops back to the start *...vojñúda sa mizñúda...*
