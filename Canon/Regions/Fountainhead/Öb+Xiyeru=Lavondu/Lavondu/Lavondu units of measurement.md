In the [[10th century]], a [[Lavondu]] council surveyed the use of weights and measures throughout [[T'ugü]] and consolidated them into a standard system which was used for centuries after by the [[Lavondu Commonwealth]], and influenced the units of measurement in many other cultures throughout history. 

The basic unit of length was the *lífel* "length/measure", commonly called *jödin* "step" when referring to distances over land, based on the old [[Xiyeru units of measurement|Xiyeru usage]], and standardised at ~61.2cm. This relatively small size reflects the slightly shorter stature of the [[Lavondu]] populace, and indeed the *öbja jödin* "[[Öb|Öb's]] step" was also in colloquial use, equal to 7/8 lífel (~53.6cm). The lífel was divided into 16 *díji* (~3.83cm), a word derived from both the [[Xiyeru units of measurement|tiži]] and [[Xiyeru units of measurement#Angular sections|rhiži]], coming to broadly mean a 1/16th measure in many different contexts beyond just the 1/16th angle. The díji was considered to be the width of the index and middle finger together, making it double the original [[Xiyeru]] [[Xiyeru units of measurement|tiži]].

While the pattern of division by 16 was continued in [[Lavondu]] metrology, greater units were formed by multiplying the lífel by 50. The *íjab*, from [[Low Alöbi]] *icab* "to lay out/position far apart", was equal to 50 lífel, while 50 íjab was one *orí-jödin* "2,500-step". The díji, lífel, íjab and orí-jödin were universal lengths used throughout the [[Lavondu]] world, with many other related units in variable use, including a hand-based system similar to the [[Xiyeru units of measurement|Xiyeru tradition]]. A census in the [[13th century]] revealed the following lengths in use, listed as multiples of lífel with approximations assuming the standard 61.2cm lífel, though its true length had diverged from place to place:
