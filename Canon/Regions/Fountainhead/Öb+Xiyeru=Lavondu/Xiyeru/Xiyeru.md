## Parts of the self
The traditional Xiyeru concept of the self was simply called **Eru**, a word broadly meaning "person" or "identity" depending on context. The Eru is a composition of three cyclically dependent parts called the **Seweru** "three-eru":
- **Tabu** (body)
- **Cere** (blood)
- **Rhova** (spirit)

Each part depends on the other two to keep a person alive. The body contains the blood, which binds the spirit together and gives it form, and the spirit animates the body. Conversely, the spirit energises the blood, which empowers the body and enables it to protect the spirit.

The Eru is at the core of the Xiyeru worldview, informing aspects of [[Xiyeru religion|religion]], [[Xiyeru communities|social relationships]], and [[Xiyeru medicine|medical practices]], through the belief that the materials that compose the Seweru are individually eternal and essentially immutable. A person is simply the coincidence of these materials for the duration of their life, which will later go on to be parts of new people.
### Connection to parts of the world
The words **pwaraza** "land-stuff", **umuraza** "water-stuff" and **ibaraza** "sky-stuff" were often used to describe the worldly materials with the potential to become the body, blood and spirit respectively, connecting the Seweru to the three primary parts of the world. These terms describe intrinsic types of material and should not be confused with states of matter, to which they don't necessarily correspond. For example, *ibaraza* is generally associated with starlight and clouds rather than the air, while *umuraza* includes snow and ice, sometimes found at the highest peaks of [[Udovu ºo]].

As soon as possible after death, the Seweru are returned to their respective realms, forming the basis of the Xiyeru funerary rites which remained in practice in some form from prehistory to long after the fall of the [[Azodo Government|Azodo state]]. First, the blood is drained from the body and poured into the local river, so that it may form the blood of future people. Next, a pit is dug in the ground and the body cremated in it, this ensures that the spirit is fully extracted from the body and released into the sky. The pit is then filled in, this is considered a restoration of the land from which the body's material originates, rather than a disposal of remains.
