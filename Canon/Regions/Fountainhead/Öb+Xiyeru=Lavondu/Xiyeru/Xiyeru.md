The **Xiyeru** were a group of related peoples on [[Winter]] with a long history of connections and influence over many places around the coast of [[Fountainhead]], and a bit beyond.
# Society
## Identity
Individual identity was expressed primarily through a system of complex tattoos known as [[ńaʼay]], with personal names, called [[ńuʼu]], acting as a linguistic reflection of the tattoo. The [[ńaʼay]] was a cultural constant for millennia in [[Udovuʼo]] and is considered the most characteristic feature of Xiyeru culture, and later influenced the high culture of the [[Lavondu]] elite.
### Gender
The Xiyeru distinguished three gender groups, female, male, and a third gender, which broadly dictated certain societal roles. Gender roles were strictly upheld, but they did inform restrictive cultural aspects like the always-female [[Āeruweʼa]] and male-line political inheritance.
#### Female
Women generally held de facto power through spiritual leadership roles like the [[Eruweʼa]] and [[Āeruweʼa]]. Ancestry was typically traced through matrilineal lines, and the mother's name was an important part of the [[ńuʼu]].
#### Male
Male gender roles traditionally encompassed ceremonial political activities. The five governorships, and certain other important political offices, were patrilineal-hereditary positions in the traditional Xiyeru political system, converse but parallel to the the usual practice of tracking ancestry matrilineally. Politics was always a man's game, though they held no real power and really their job was just to show up at important ceremonies and ritually move debts around between tribes.
#### Third gender
The Xiyeru third gender was called *myogiru* "among women" or *yādagiru* "appearing women" in [[Xiri]], with the former being the basis of the equivalent [[Ahōtoli]] and [[Möxali]] terms *nekĭlu* and *mísul* respectively. It encompasses a broad range of non-binary gender identities which often align more with feminine than masculine expression, and is socially associated with a stronger spiritual connection of the body, blood and spirit to their corresponding worldly materials. Third gender people were considered to have a connection to medicine, and more broadly with the study of the natural world.
## Social structure
Xiyeru society was structured around [[Xiyeru communities|matrilineal families]], with elder women representing the majority of important cultural leadership roles, one such being the de facto head of the whole culture, the [[Āeruweʼa]], "great mother".

Xiyeru communities can be considered at three different scales represented by the typical three-level heritage used in [[Xiyeru]] culture:
1. **Egiruweʼa** "the mother", representing the immediate family and ancestors
2. **Todo** "the village", representing the relationships between families
3. **Tovuʼo** "the home island", representing a broader sense of cultural heritage
### Families
The most tightly bound and meaningful units of society were matrilineal families. This stems from the idea that the primary societal relationship a person has, and the only one considered immutable, is that with their mother, whose [[Ńuʼu#Xińuʼu|xińuʼu]] "true-name" is incorporated into the [[Ńaʼay|tattoo]] of every person. Despite this, matrilineage was generally not considered beyond one's mother, and bloodlines were not typically tracked or maintained. As such, for a long time there were no grand noble houses, though certain families within a village may be considered prestigious and desirable to marry into, leading to some stratification of society. Anyone may marry into a family with a woman whose mother is also of that family.

During the [[Xiyeru Confederation]], the noble [[Nīholu]] culture developed in [[Azodo]], where some families were designated certain social responsibilities and held an elevated status.
### Villages
Xiyeru villages had populations of several hundred and were fairly centralised, with the largest settlements having thousands and beginning to operate like cities at the turn of the second millennium AGS.

People very rarely migrated between villages, a person's places of birth, life and death would often have been within sight of each other. Of course, the Xiyeru did routinely travel far out to sea, but always returned to their home village and kept tattoos to remind them of this called [[Ńaʼay#Other tattoos|eruńaʼay]] "people-markings".
### Islands
The five islands of [[Udovuʼo]] each had distinct cultural aspects and internal politics, but were all considered part of the Xiyeru culture. Trade and diplomatic relations between the islands were of paramount concern to Xiyeru politicians, who were semi-elected officials appointed to very specific roles, such as ensuring good rice harvests in certain villages. The production and movement of food, especially rice, was the main avenue through which political power was exercised. The southern island, [[Azodo]], was especially separated, tending to be more isolationist throughout history and with the more politically inclined populace rejecting broad monocultural elements, such as the use of [[Xiri]] as a lingua franca. When [[Azodo]] became politically influential in the [[8th century]] with the formation of the [[Xiyeru Confederation]], the lingua franca gradually switched to its own native language [[Ahōtoli]].
## Politics



# Culture
## Agriculture and cuisine
Yams, called *kwi*, were a staple vegetable cultivated by the Xiyeru since prehistory. Yams in [[Udovuʼo]] vary from island to island, but are typically longer than they are wide and sweet. Some islands have shorter, wider, starchier, less sweet yams as well. They are also typically dark, usually a deep purple. Yams were used by the Xiyeru to make bread, wine (called *warań*), stews, soups, stocks, and other assorted foodstuffs, and they can also be eaten cooked without processing. Various kinds of gourds, beans, alliums and root vegetables were also cultivated on a smaller scale by the Xiyeru.

Rice was the other staple cultivar in [[Udovuʼo]], and of great importance to Xiyeru culture. Good rice harvests were associated with economic security and times of prosperity. [[Udovuʼo]] rice is sticky and dark in colour, almost black, and reveals a rich violet pigmentation when boiled in water. Both the yams and rice may have been specifically cultivated by the ancient people of [[Udovuʼo]] to yield their characteristic deep purple hues. Each island had unique dishes and methods of preparation involving rice, usually involving washing the rice numerous times and overboiling, then draining the remaining purple water, which was sometimes collected for various purposes.

Alcohol, called *warań* in [[Xiri]], was made from both yams and rice, and along with *saža* (a kind of tea), were prevalent drinks in Xiyeru culture. Warań and saža were often consumed at uzēba "festivals" that commemorated holidays, successful catches, or important events like the heralding of a new [[Āeruweʼa]].
## Sailing
The Xiyeru are known for their prolific [[Sailing in Fountainhead|history of sailing]] and their navigation of the islands throughout the ocean north of [[Fountainhead]]. In the [[1st century]], people from [[Udovuʼo]] began sailing to [[T'ugü]] and other regions on the mainland, eventually leading to the development of the [[Lavondu]] culture and the subsequent spread of sailing technology further south.
## Music
One common musical instrument used by the Xiyeru was the *yējaw* "together-string", a two or three stringed instrument that was played for festivals or entertainment on. Its body would be made out of a hollowed-out large gourd, while the neck was formed from a hollowed out bone, with frets extending out from the bone-neck. After around the [[5th century]], the words *yē* "together, twinly, bonded" and *ye* "plant" phonetically merged, leading to a common folk etymology which postulated that the name came from the ancient use plant strings. In reality the strings were likely always made from sinew, with plant fibers rarely used for strings of any kind in [[Udovuʼo]].

The [[Xiyeru]] also constructed passive musical instruments like chimes and resonating gongs, which would be triggered by natural phenomena, typically the wind and [[soundquakes]]. Shrines called *fazžibi-rom* "singing-table" were designed to pick out harmonic sets of frequencies from [[soundquakes]] and amplify them via resonance. Singing tables work best when unimpeded by stray vibrations from civilian life, so were typically found irregularly along remote mountain roads. They were the strongest deliberate [[soundquake]]-resonators which were built anywhere in the world in their time, and though distant and isolated, their harmonies could be heard in mountain villages miles away shortly before the effects of the [[soundquake]], or associated earthquake, were even realised locally, and could continue to sing for several minutes after the [[soundquake]] had ended.
# Beliefs
## Parts of the self
The traditional Xiyeru concept of the self was simply called *eru*, a word broadly meaning "person", "identity" or "soul" depending on context. The eru is a composition of three cyclically dependent parts called the *seweru* "three-eru":
- **Tabu** (body)
- **Cere** (blood)
- **Rhova** (spirit)

Each part depends on the other two to keep a person alive. The body contains the blood, which binds the spirit together and gives it form, and the spirit animates the body. Conversely, the spirit energises the blood, which empowers the body and enables it to protect the spirit.

The eru is at the core of the Xiyeru worldview, informing aspects of [[Xiyeru religion|religion]], [[Xiyeru communities|social relationships]], and [[Xiyeru medicine|medical practices]], through the belief that the materials that compose the seweru are individually eternal and essentially immutable. A person is simply the coincidence of these materials for the duration of their life, which will later go on to be parts of new people.
### Connection to parts of the world
The words *pwaraza* "land-stuff", *umuraza* "water-stuff" and *ibaraza* "sky-stuff" were often used to describe the worldly materials with the potential to become the body, blood and spirit respectively, connecting the seweru to the three primary parts of the world. These terms describe intrinsic types of material and should not be confused with states of matter, to which they don't necessarily correspond. For example, ibaraza is generally associated with starlight and clouds rather than the air, while umuraza includes snow and ice, sometimes found at the highest peaks of [[Udovuʼo]].

As soon as possible after death, the seweru are returned to their respective realms, forming the basis of the Xiyeru funerary rites which remained in practice in some form from prehistory to long after the fall of the [[Xiyeru Confederation]]. First, the blood is drained from the body and poured into the local river, so that it may form the blood of future people. Next, a pit is dug in the ground and the body cremated in it, this ensures that the spirit is fully extracted from the body and released into the sky. The pit is then filled in, this is considered a restoration of the land from which the body's material originates, rather than a disposal of remains.
## Religion
The Xiyeru practised a folk religion based on ancestor worship and the continued preservation of ancestral knowledge, with a long-standing [[Nejinayon|historical tradition]] which took the form of purely oral recitation for millennia until the [[Savamāri|invention of writing]] in the 1st millennium BGS.

Their folklore varied between islands and involved many characters and stories, some of which, like [[Grandmother Ōgogo]] are fairly mundane, while other more universal myths were quite profound and cosmological, like the creator deity [[Fururūʼupwa]].
### Living spirit and legacy spirit
While a person was alive, their eru was called *heweru* "living-spirit", and after death this transformed into the *mūʼoru* "legacy-spirit", which also refers to the state of the spirit before it is bound into physical form at birth. The two states of the spirit is an important concept in ancestor worship, as it was believed that a person's Mūʼoru could be invoked by calling out their [[Ńuʼu#Mūʼojūńuʼu|mūʼojūńuʼu]], a name given to a person upon death to refer to them posthumously. It was likewise taboo to utter any significant part of the living name after death, especially for important historical figures, as doing so would be calling the heweru back to life, an idea to which the Xiyeru were strongly opposed.
