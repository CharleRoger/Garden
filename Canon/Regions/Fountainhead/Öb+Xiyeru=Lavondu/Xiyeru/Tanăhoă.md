***Tanăhoă*** was the name given to the [[Blacksharks|Blackshark]] flagship, which underwent several iterations in its history, as [[Sailing in Fountainhead|Xiyeru ships]] were regularly dismantled and rebuilt. *Tanăhoă* is the [[Ahōtoli]] name of the [[Xiyeru]] deity *[[Tenazoh]]*, said to be a giant two-headed bird of prey, in particular identified with the *sōyāʼă*, a hawk species endemic to [[Udovuʼo]].

The ship which first bore the name *Tanăhoă* was built in 1136 and captained by [[Hehăkē]]. Its two hulls appropriately featured figureheads in the form of the head of the sōyāʼă, each with a corresponding wing-like embellishment at the stern. The hulls were 37m long, or a little over 40m including adornments, connected by a central platform approximately 22m x 10m. Each of its six masts were 12m in length and unusually could all move freely, that is to say none of the three sails had a fixed mast, rather both free masts were able to be reoriented and fixed into position by several ropes.

Though the ship varied throughout history, the crew complement generally remained consistent, nominally 81 divided like so:
- 32 (16×2) oarsmen
- 16 (8×2) general deck crew
- 16 (8×2) variable specialised deck crew (archers, carpenters, etc.)
- 12 variable administrative roles (navigators, interpreters, etc.)
- 4 executive officers (crew commanders each with a specialised role and acting as second in command to the captain, and who wear the [[Blacksharks|eponymous black cloaks]])
- 1 captain

The Tanăhoă could comfortably travel at 5-6 knots with oarsmen on rotation, allowing it to generally make voyages at over 200km per day, but could reach a top speed of 8 knots under the combined power of sails and all 32 oars.
