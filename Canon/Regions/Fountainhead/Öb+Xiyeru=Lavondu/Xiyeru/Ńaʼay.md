One of the most characteristic and persistent elements of the [[Xiyeru]] culture is their tattoos, which took many forms and styles throughout their history, some of which spread to other cultures, most notably the [[Lavondu]]. There were many types of tattoo that could be given to a person for a variety of reasons, such as certain points in their life, in recognition of good deeds, or just purely cosmetics.

Tattoos were broadly referred to as *ńaʼay* "marking", a word also applied to writing, which later in history can be seen in the forms *ńaʼai* and *ńaʼe*. The entire identifying set of tattoos of a person was referred to by the collective plural *uńaʼay*. Tattooists were called *ńaʼayeru* "marking-person", which was a sacred role handled only by a small handful of elders in the village.
# History
The earliest evidence for the practice of tattooing in [[Udovuʼo]] comes from around 4000 BGS or earlier, and similar practices are found in the cultures of certain islands of [[Fountainhead]], particularly [[Buhō]], [[Ō-Hilau]] and [[uSasa-Uhō]].

Early ńaʼay was more abstract in structure, taking essentially any form the artist felt like, though utilising common stylistic elements. As writing became more widely used, ńaʼay became more structured and rigorously linked to the personal name, until the names became essentially a reading of the tattoo. It is not clear from historical evidence whether the first writing in [[Udovuʼo]] was directly derived from the ńaʼay, or whether the morphology of the tattoos shifted to be more linguistic in response to the rise of writing, but the two parallel developments are certainly closely linked.

With the formation of the [[Xiyeru Confederation]] came the concept of [[Xiyeru]] citizenship, under which the uńaʼay became a person's official identification. Throughout the [[10th century]], there was even legislation passed which constrained the design and use of the ńaʼay, causing them to become more formulaic and less artistically expressive, though still a marvel to behold.

Wearing a complex and widespread ńaʼay was naturally an object of prestige to the [[Xiyeru]], and this was exacerbated by the [[Nīholu]] noble culture, resulting in a few changes to the visual style of the tattoos:
- They tended to cover more skin in denser patterns of repeating symbols.
- The chest and calves were no longer reserved for only the special tattoos given as a person nears their death.
- Extensive tattooing above the knee became common, which was generally forbidden previously.

Common people usually retained the more traditional simple tattoos on the face and neck with fairly modest arrangements on the arms and ankles.
# Wōjama
The most widely recognised and practiced type of [[Xiyeru]] tattoo was a series of maturity-warding tattoos that every person received in accordance with age rituals. These were called the *wōjama* (“may-(you)-be-wells”). They symbolise wellness and good wishes. Note that all ages listed below follow the [[Xiyeru#Age system|Xiyeru age system]] which counts the number of 385-day calendar rounds a person has lived through.
## Wōmavanaʼa
The first set of wōjama is a series of mouth tattoos called the *wōmavanaʼa* (“may-(you)-speak-wells”) that one gets at the age of 9 or 10. These vary by region; however, one similarity is that they all have lines coming from the mouth to the nose. These lines may be colored in or not; they are almost always straight (with at least one recorded exception in a distant village). These tattoos are meant to ward off angry spirits that may cause someone to yell or verbally hurt their fellow person.
## Wōmajanēs
The second is a series of feet and ankle tattoos called the *wōmajanēs* (“may-(you)-step-wells”) that one receives when they turn 14. These are meant to symbolise good luck in one's travels on solid land.
## Wōmavuru
When one turns 15 or 16 they receive the most important series of hand, wrist, and forearm tattoos called the *wōmavuru* (“may-(you)-do-good-works”); many regions are known to have intricate and detailed back-of-hand tattoos, 3 blacked out bars on the wrist (of body, spirit, and blood), and intricately done forearm tattoos. The portions of the tattoo done on the hand are known to fade, so it is commonplace for these tattoos to be touched up and reworked as time passes. It is very taboo for a person to allow these tattoos to become egregiously faded.
## Wōmavawiʼi
The second to last series of tattoos is received when one turns 25. They are a series of forehead and eye-area tattoos that are called the *wōmavawiʼi* (“may-(you)-see-wells”). As one gets older they become a more trusted hunter and [[Sailing in Fountainhead#Ancient Xiyeru ships|boat-person]], this tattoo is meant to ensure that they are well focused and ready on the sea whenever it is needed.
## Wōmajazava
The last set of chest, back and calf tattoos, *wōmajazava* (“may-(you)-die-wells”) or *wōmajamoyu* (“may-(you)-sleep-wells”) is received when one is nearing their death. It is meant to symbolise one's connection with nature, the deities, one's community, and the [[Āeruweʼa]].
# Other tattoos
There are other various tattoos that one can get when they perform various acts of bravery. These are called *ugumamavuru* (“many-many-very-good-deeds”).

Parental tattoos are called *uweʼańaʼay* (“river-markings”) and are meant to symbolise the parent's connection with the river deity (goddess of parenting, leadership, and rivers).

Kinship tattoos are called the *weruńaʼay* (“people-markings”), and these are meant to symbolise one's tribe, mother, and region. Due to the [[Xiyeru|Xiyeru's]] tendency to travel far from their home village on foot or by boat, it is very important that these tattoos relate individually to one's home village as it is seen as incredibly rude to your ancestors to forget your home. Not only do these tattoos tell others where they are from, as a sense of pride in your home village, but they also remind one of their home, so they never become too homesick during travels.
# Connection to names and writing
The pictographic symbols employed in the ńaʼay were connected to lexical elements of the spoken personal names, called [[ńuʼu]]. The most widely used script for recording the [[Xiri]] language was the [[Ugugo]], a purely phonetic syllabary, but personal names were typically written using adapted forms of these pictographs.

The earliest attested form of the [[Ugugo]], known as the [[Savamāri|Savamaric abjad]], has letter forms which bear striking resemblance to the written forms of ńaʼay symbols, but no direct connection between characters has been confirmed. The ńaʼay predates the use of writing in [[Udovuʼo]] by several millennia, so if they did emerge directly from the linguistic reading of a tattoo as a personal name, this would represent a unique case in writing first developed in the medium of tattoo.

Under the influence of writing elsewhere in [[Udovuʼo]], the tattoo pictography evolved into a true logographic system in [[Azodo]], eventually becoming the official writing system used by the [[Xiyeru Confederation]] to write the [[Ahōtoli]] language, which also included purely phonetic elements.
## Example
The connection between the tattoo and the personal name is shown below using the example of [[Koxĭya Ahoukēholuʼŭihă]], the first governor of [[T'ugü]] installed by the [[Azodo Government]], whose name is particularly well-recorded for the period. Note that the lexical and pictographic forms are representative of their native language and the language of the [[Xiyeru Confederation]], [[Ahōtoli]].

![[koxĭya tattoo example.png]]

[[Koxĭya Ahoukēholuʼŭihă|Koxĭya]] was part of the [[Azodo]] nobility and as such their tattoo would have been particularly more ornate than that of an average person. Only some parts of the tattoo are presented, the others (which are greyed out) are either generic cultural patterns which form the [[Ńaʼay#Wōjama|wōjama]] (coming of age tattoos) or are associated with other parts of the name but omitted for simplicity. The writing of personal names using [[ńaʼay]] symbols uses all sorts of ligatures and special double-width glyphs representing certain complex words, aphorisms, names of places and astronomical objects. The individual parts of the name being explored are presented as they might appear in important documents and historical records, with a rectangular border as standard. For each name, the glyphs which are represented in the tattoo are also shown. The full name is written at the top in elemental [[ńaʼay]] glyphs with traditional [[Savamāric Ugugo]] consonant letters for comparison, though a name would never actually be written out this way in full.

The [[Ńuʼu#Xińuʼu|xińuʼu]] "true-name" is the only part of the name which may not be incorporated into the tattoo, but it is often represented on the front of the neck and sometimes wraps around to the back. In this case the [[Ńuʼu#Xińuʼu|xińuʼu]], *Koxĭya* "Obsidian-wing", has been simply represented using its constituent [[ńaʼay]] glyphs.

[[Ńaʼay#Other tattoos|Ugumamavuru]] "many very good deeds" can be incorporated into any part of the [[Ńaʼay#Wōjama|wōjama]], but are more commonly a separate band on the upper arms or lower thighs, as they are here. *Eʼō-ene* "Who brings rice" is represented simply, similar to the [[Ńuʼu#Xińuʼu|xińuʼu]]. *ʼu-hi A-ʼĭo-lu Lăwo-toto-kī’ă* "First Governor in the Foreign-villages" is a bit more complex, each of the four glyphs in this particular written good-deed-name are actually ligatures. The first is a combination of *ʼu* "one" and the abjad consonant *H* as a shorthand for *ʼuhi* "first". Next are some examples of double-width glyphs. *Aʼĭolu* is formed from the glyphs *ʼĭo* "command" and *ălu* "person". *Lăwototo* "Foreign-villages" (the [[Lavondu]] settlements in [[T'ugü]], called *[[Rhavo todo]]* in Xiri) is represented by a glyph which incorporates aspects of the *lăwo* "foreign, different" glyph into an existing double-width glyph *toto* "village" formed by stitching two *to* "house, place" glyphs together. The locative case *kīʼă* is written here with a common shorthand form with the letters *K* and *ʼ* stacked together.

The [[Ńaʼay#Other tattoos|weruńaʼay]] "people-markings" always include a large glyph in the centre of the chest associated with the [[Ńuʼu#Weruńuʼu|weruńuʼu]] "people-name" and often connected with a representation of the mother's name, which may also appear on the shoulders. In this case, the [[Ńaʼay#Other tattoos|weruńaʼay]] appears as a medallion hung around the neck, a common style for the period. The components of the mother's name *Ńū-ōkĭ-kī* and the [[Ńuʼu#Weruńuʼu|weruńuʼu]] *Esĭ-īxĭ-ʼela-kī* are carefully combined into compact forms which merge aspects of each glyph in such a way that each individual glyph can still be recognised.

The [[Ńaʼay#Other tattoos|uweʼańaʼay]] "river-markings" usually take the form of a meandering, space-filling curve which wraps around the chest or waist. The *ăluweʼă* "parent" glyph is used to refer to any parent in writing, though the words *ekĭluweʼă* "mother" and *eńĭluwe’ă* "father" are distinct in [[Ahōtoli]].
