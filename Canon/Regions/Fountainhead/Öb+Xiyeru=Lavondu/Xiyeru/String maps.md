**String maps** were navigational aids made and used by the [[Xiyeru]] in the [[Sunrise period]] (729 [[Universal calendar|BGS]] - 67 [[Universal calendar|AGS]]) and [[Horizon period]] (67 [[Universal calendar|AGS]] - 655 [[Universal calendar|AGS]]).

Most string maps consisted of a single strand of string, onto which were tied stones, shells, beads and feathers representing ocean swells, islands, rivers or other geographic features. The maps were probably not actually used to navigate in a strict sense, since they only recorded a basic topology of features and not their geographic arrangement, rather they were mnemonic devices which would aid a navigator's memory retrieval, their teaching of navigational information to others, or as an itinerary record. String maps can be accompanied by a similarly mnemonic poem or mantra which is memorised and recited by the user.

Two types of string map are generally identified by the [[Xiyeru]] themselves:
- **teńivūra** "swell-string", primarily representing ocean swells, but also islands and broadly indicating sailing routes between them. Swell-strings could be quite complex, sometimes having branching strings and encoding many different kinds of features without ambiguity.
- **ʼaravūra** "shore-string", representing identifiable geographic features along coastlines. These were of particular utility to early explorers of the [[Fountainhead]] coast, but also found use among diplomats and priests on missions to other home-islands. Such shore-strings representing the five home-islands are naturally tied into a loop, and became a commonly worn accessory by the first [[Xiyeru]] settlers in [[T'ugü]] as a memento of home.
# World map
[[Xiyeru]] string maps may constitute the first attempts at creating maps of the entire known world, particularly those created in the latter part of the [[Horizon period]] by explorers with the explicit goal of extending the boundaries of what was known of [[Fountainhead]]. Such comprehensive world maps, which were hybrid in form combing both "swell-string" and "shore-string" constructions, were mainly an intellectual exercise and a display of power, since they were large and unwieldy and not precise enough to serve any practical purpose.
## Fīkwaziguma's Map
One of the most detailed and complete world maps attributed to this period of cartography was called *fūra Fīkwazigumaže* in [[Xiri]], literally "Fīkwaziguma's string", named for [[Rhamari Fīkwaziguma Āeruweʼa]] who is said to have commissioned its composition c. 650.

The map depicts [[Udovuʼo]] as a complex web at its centre; the [[Spiderstones]] branching off as a fairly abstract mass of string and feathers; the newly discovered sky-islands of [[Cqa]]; and the [[Fountainhead]] coast centred on [[T'ugü]], with [[Irimri]] leading to some prominent eastern islands like [[Ō-Hilau]] and [[Buhō]] at one extremity and a low-detail [[Qnōp']] ending in a series of islands at the other. Contemporary [[Xiyeru]] written sources are unclear as to the identity of the southern isles, but they are probably parts of [[Krobu]], as it is reasonably likely that the [[Xiyeru]] reached this far south at least once before the [[Exodus period]].

After three centuries of preservation in the [[garden palace]] on [[Erido]], Fīkwaziguma's map was presented as a diplomatic gift to [[Ansang Empire|Ansang emperor]] [[Erero'oŋgoŋ]] by the [[Āʼiyoru|governor]] of [[Erido]] in 950. String map technology was already something of a novelty by this time, but Fīkwaziguma's map was considered a great [[Xiyeru]] treasure, representative of a pivotal time in their history, and certainly not to be given away lightly. In order to demonstrate the ancient wisdom of the [[Xiyeru]], it was asserted at the time that the southern islands were in fact [[Ansang Islands|Ansang]], but this is unlikely as [[Ansang people|Ansang's]] own oral histories don't tell of any contact from the period.

Around a decade later, the [[Ardanic people|Ardanic]] scholar [[Psirin Aster]] encountered the map and described it in a treatise on the [[Lavondu]] culture, though it actually predated the existence of the [[Lavondu]]-proper by several centuries.
