The **Tarodaroeru** were the semi-legendary first civilisation of [[Udovuʼo]] in the [[Xiyeru]] historical tradition. They were said to have later split into five distinct peoples who were the ancestors of all later peoples of the five [[Udovuʼo|home islands]]. They are credited with the development of various important aspects of [[Xiyeru]] culture, including the [[Ńaʼay]], [[Sailing in Fountainhead|sailing technology]], and rice cultivation.

# Etymology

*[[Xiri dictionary#tarodaroeru|Taro-daro-eru]]* literally means "old-old-people" or "ancient people". *[[Xiri dictionary#taro|Taro]]* alone can mean ancient, but the reduplication here emphasises a meaning of *most* ancient or primeval, as the Tarodaroeru were considered to be the first civilisation of the current historical aeon.

# Historicity

The historicity of the Tarodaroeru is debated, but generally appears fairly accurate. The first evidence of human activity on [[Udovuʼo]] comes from the [[5th millennium BGS|5th]] or [[6th millennium BGS]], with petroglyphs dated to around 3,000 BGS exhibiting various symbols which later appeared in the [[Ńaʼay]] tattoo system. The main inaccuracy stems from the fact that the [[Xiyeru]] considered [[Udovuʼo]] to be the birthplace of humanity, thus the Tarodaroeru represented an unbroken history of settlement by their ancestors stretching all the way back to [[Kiyeru]] and [[Ńiyeru]], the first two humans created by [[Fururūʼupwa]]. In reality, the ancestors of the Xiyeru settled [[Udovuʼo]] via maritime navigation from other islands to the east, most likely [[Buhō]].
