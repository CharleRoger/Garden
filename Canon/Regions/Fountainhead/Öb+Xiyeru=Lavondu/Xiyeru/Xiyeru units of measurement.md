The [[Xiyeru]] employed many units of measurement throughout their history, perhaps the earliest of which was the *taba* "step", simply equal to a stride length of about ~70cm. This measure was never itself formalised as a standard unit by the [[Xiyeru]], though other units derived from it were, and it also lent its name to the journey-length measures detailed [[Xiyeru units of measurement#Journey lengths|below]].

The most ubiquitous system historically used in [[Udovuʼo]] was based on the the width of a finger, typically a bit under 2cm, and simply called *tiži* "finger". Other dimensions of the hand and arm were then said to be related to the tiži by square-numbered ratios as follows:
- 4 tiži (7-8cm) = *tiwā* "palm", the width of the palm
- 9 tiži (16-18cm) = *uru* "hand", from the tip of the middle finger to the wrist
- 16 tiži (28-32cm) = *yāje* "limb/beam", from the wrist to the elbow
- 25 tiži (45-50cm) = *ʼaja* "elbow", from the tip of the middle finger to the elbow

Other length units were based on every-day objects and related by ratios which varied through history and from island to island, for example the *tubu* "grain" was 1/4 or 1/3 of a tiži (4-7mm), the length of a grain of rice, while a *mwaru* "pole" was 2 tiži (3.5-4cm), the diameter of a common type of bamboo pole.
# Angular sections
Many units of measurement used by the [[Xiyeru]] were ultimately derived from the angular unit simply called *rhiži* "section, division", equal to one sixteenth of a circle, or 22.5°. Each rhiži is further divided into sixteen *sāriži* "small section", for a total of 256 minor divisions of the circle, a number which is given the special name *cariweu* "perfect-number" in certain contexts such as this one.

Following from this, the day and night are each divided into eight sections properly called *ūba-riži* "day-section", but usually just called rhiži without specification. The length of a rhiži is not necessarily equal to 1/16th of a day (90 minutes) since the daylight hours change with the seasons. The [[Xiyeru]] were aware of this fact, despite their proximity to the equator and the low axial tilt of [[Winter]] meaning that the length of the rhiži only varied from around 88 to 92 minutes throughout the year. In [[Xiyeru]] culture, *uru-riži* is a common rule of thumb, and later official law, meaning that any kind of labour should not be undertaken for more than five of the eight rhiži in a day, equal to 7.5 hours. It is a play on words using uru "hand" which is also used to refer to work or labour, as well as a set of five things.
# Journey lengths
Two units of "distance" are based on the ūba-riži. The first is *ādaba* "big-step", the distance that can be travelled by foot in one rhiži, equal to about 6-8km, which can just be called *taba* "step/walk" if context permits. The ādaba was not strictly defined in terms of other length units, but was sometimes said to be equal to 10,000 taba (~7km). When considering long journeys of multiple days, the rule of uru-riži suggests five ādaba can be travelled in a day, around 30-40km, sometimes called *uru-nēs* or *ūba-nēs* "day-journey".

The second unit is the analogous *hāra-daba* "ship-step", equivalent to one ūba-riži of sailing in favourable conditions. This unit varies quite a bit more than the ādaba as it depends on prevailing windspeed, ocean currents, and the length of the journey itself, since short island-hops and coastal tracks can't take advantage of the higher windspeed out on the open sea. Unlike travel on land, a ship can sail continuously for a 24 hour period, travelling around 80-150km, with [[Sailing in Fountainhead#Threesail|later ships developed by the Lavondu]] making certain long journeys at over 200km a day. This puts the length of the [[hāra-daba]] at anywhere from 5 to 15km depending.

Despite this variability, a given journey from A to B has a fairly reliable duration in favourable conditions, and indeed the [[Xiyeru]] recorded canonical distances between locations measured in [[hāra-daba]]. This measurement is a sort of standardised ideal duration, representative of an abstract "amount" of sailing, while the actual duration of a voyage would not be measured in taba, but in real time. It's worth emphasising that the taba length is only correlated with, but not equivalent to a physical distance. In fact, a journey from A to B generally does not have the same length as the return from B to A, since one direction will have more favourable wind and currents. For example, a journey of 100km along a coast might be considered a 12 taba (16 hours) journey, while the return voyage could be 16 taba (24 hours) against the prevailing wind. A 10x greater voyage of 160 taba (10 days) might cover 20x the distance on the open sea, but if the winds are particularly bad it could end up taking as much as 40 days.
## Examples
The following outbound and return journey lengths are taken from a sailor's almanac from the [[11th century]]. The actual distances and an artistic interpretation of these journeys on a map, which were not recorded in the source document, are also shown.

| ------------------------------------------ | -------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| [[Ujarudaru]] to [[Surareʼa]]              | 120km    | 16 taba (24 hours)   | 18 taba (27 hours)   |
