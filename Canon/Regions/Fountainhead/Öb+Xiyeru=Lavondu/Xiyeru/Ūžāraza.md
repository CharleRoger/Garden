In [[Xiyeru]] culture, the **Ūžāraza** are the three fundamental substances of the universe, from which all other complex substances are composed.

# Etymology

*[[Xiri dictionary#ūžāraza|Ūžā-raza]]* means "whole-stuff" and is contrasted with *[[Xiri dictionary#’awaraza|ʼawa-raza]]* "mixture-stuff", all other complex substances composed of the fundamental three.

# Types

The three ūžāraza are:

1. **ībaraza** "sky-stuff"
2. **ūmuraza** "water-stuff" 
3. **pwaraza** "land-stuff" 

These terms describe intrinsic types of material and should not be confused with states of matter, to which they do not necessarily correspond. For example, ībaraza was generally associated with starlight and clouds rather than the air, while ūmuraza included snow and ice, sometimes found at the highest peaks of [[Udovuʼo]].

The ūžāraza were said to have been created by [[Fururūʼupwa]] during the creation of the universe and subsequently came to be governed by the first three [[ībarovā|celestial children]]: ībaraza by [[Faraʼeība]], ūmuraza by [[Fadanaūmu]], and pwaraza by [[Fayobozimi]].
