The **Āeruweʼa** was the spiritual leader of the [[Xiyeru]] who acted as the highest authority on [[Xiyeru]] religion and cultural practices. For almost 2,000 years of recorded history, there was an unbroken chain of Āeruweʼa, and this likely extends further before the [[Savamāri|development of writing]]. In fact, the [[Ugugo]] script and the means to write it were developed in part due to the desire to record the life of the Āeruweʼa in as much detail as possible, a practice which continued for as long as the Āeruweʼa itself.

The role of the Āeruweʼa, who was always a woman, changed throughout time. She was technically not a politician, but every person of status in [[Udovuʼo]] would answer to her and ultimately she acted as a sort of head of state in many respects, until the events of the [[Exodus period]] caused a broad loss of faith in her authority.

It was said that the Āeruweʼa was the physical embodiment of the entire history of the [[Xiyeru]] culture in a single person. There was no Āeruweʼa without the [[Xiyeru]], and no [[Xiyeru]] without the Āeruweʼa.

# Etymology

*Āeruweʼa* is simply an augmentative form of *[[Eruweʼa]]* "person of the river", a title given to parents and spiritual leaders.

# Public image

The Āeruweʼa would only ever be seen by the general populace in ceremonial wear, ornately interwoven cloths adorned with strings of multi-coloured beads, and was one of the only people to wear shoes. She would also wear gold bangles on the wrists and ankles, keeping the tattoos on the arms and legs exposed.

# Lifestyle and duties

The Āeruweʼa would reside in the [[garden palace]] of her [[Udovuʼo|home island]], which was almost always the main central island [[Erido]] also known as *Āeruweʼado* for a time. The prestige language of [[Udovuʼo]] was chosen as the dialect of the Āeruweʼa, hence the lingua franca for most of AGS history being a standardised form of the [[Erido]] dialect.

Unlike the [[Eruweʼa]], who were all mothers before being granted their position by their community, the Āeruweʼa would be set on her path from childhood. The first duty of a newly ascended Āeruweʼa was to seek out her potential successors. This would take several years and see the Āeruweʼa travel to every corner of [[Udovuʼo]] to meet with thousands of families, learning about each and every young girl who was considered eligible. Around ten girls would eventually be chosen for their tenacity, intelligence and commitment to tradition and culture. From that day on, they would live entirely within the confines of the [[garden palace]], being trained by the [[Eruweʼa]] and the Āeruweʼa herself. When the Āeruweʼa approaches her death, she would select her successor from her disciples, the rest of which would continue to care for and live closely with the successor. Under this system, a new Āeruweʼa would typically be around 40-70 [[Winter#Length of the year|years]] old when they would finally ascend, around half way through their life.

They lived exceptionally long lives, with the Āeruweʼa at the time of first contact with the [[Öb]] in the [[1st century]] aged around 150, and the oldest person in [[Xiyeru]] history being an Āeruweʼa who reportedly lived to the age of 184. Although this was recorded by contemporary [[Xiyeru]] historians, it should of course be taken with a grain of salt, since [[Kiyeru]], the first woman, is said to have reached an age of 256, which is almost certainly not possible. Later in history, with the introduction of the [[Öcídñox]] calendar, this age was retroactively recomputed as 256 [[újnö]], 64 full calendar cycles totalling 391 years.

# Numbering

The Āeruweʼa are numbered according to their position in the line of succession. The first Āeruweʼa was the semi-legendary figure [[Fanaʼažimyu Āeruweʼa|Fanaʼažimyu]], while the first truly historical Āeruweʼa to be described in contemporary written record was said to be the 56th, [[Rhazorēʼa Fuvugaraʼe Āeruweʼa]], on which the numbering tradition is based. All 55 former Āeruweʼa are named and described in varying detail in later retrospective records, supposedly passed down by oral tradition for generations. This would indicate that the tradition stretches back perhaps even earlier than 3000 BGS, though it is equally possible that the numbers were inflated or even completely fabricated at some point in history.
