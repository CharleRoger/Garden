**Eruweʼa** was a title given to parents and spiritual leaders in the [[Xiyeru]] culture. 

Upon becoming a parent, a person would receive a special tattoo called [[Ńaʼay#We’ańa’ay|We’ańa’ay]] "river-marking" and a corresponding [[Ńuʼu#Weʼańuʼu|Weʼańuʼu]] "river-name". This name was *Egiruwe’a* for mothers and *Eńiruwe’a* for fathers, which were homophonous (Early [[Xiri]] [eˈŋiɾuˌweʔa] > Late [[Xiri]] [ɛˈŋiɾʊˌweʔə]) and distinguished only in writing. Certain mothers considered exceptionally wise and accomplished may be given the generic name *Eruweʼa*, designating them as symbolic parents to all people of the village.

Not all families had an Eruweʼa, people from other families in the village would visit them for sage advice, though it should be noted that they were not necessarily older people.

An Eruweʼa also had the unique right to freely live and work within their island's [[garden palace]].
# Etymology
*Eruweʼa* is a compound of *eru* "person" and *weʼa* "river". The unusual order of the compound as "person-river" rather than "river-person" reflects its intended meaning, a parent is a physical embodiment of [[Weʼa]], the [[Xiyeru]] concept of endless flow of ancestral knowledge via parentage. An Eruweʼa is not a person associated with [[Weʼa]], but [[Weʼa]] itself, in a person.
# Āeruweʼa
The spiritual and cultural leader of the [[Xiyeru]] was known as the [[Āeruweʼa]], an augmentative form of *Eruweʼa*, though holders of the title were never themselves a mother and were typically selected as candidates at a very young age.
