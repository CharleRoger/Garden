A **garden palace** is a grand, enclosed complex of ornate stone buildings set into resplendent flower gardens built on each of the five islands of [[Udovuʼo]], representing the only large, permanent structures built by the [[Xiyeru]] for most of their history.

The garden palaces were occupied and maintained by [[Eruweʼa]] from around each island, with no individual overseeing their continued operation. They were hermetic sanctuaries of knowledge and culture, precisely preserved according to oral and written descriptions passed down by hundreds of generations of [[Eruweʼa]]. People would make journeys of several days on foot to reach a garden palace, which were built at fairly high elevations, seeking guidance, refuge, or other charity, rarely being allowed entry into the compound itself.
