**Sārovā** "little spirits" or "lesser spirits" are a type of supernatural being in [[Xiyeru religion]]. They consist of countless mythical people, creatures and essences descended from the [[ībarovā]], the celestial creator deities in [[Xiyeru religion]]. Some sārovā were legendary figures in folklore, while others were said to be animist spiritual essences which persisted in the world contemporaneously with the [[Xiyeru]].
