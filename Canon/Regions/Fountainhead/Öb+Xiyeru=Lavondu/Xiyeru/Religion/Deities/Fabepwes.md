# Name

The name *[[Xiri dictionary#fabepwes|f-abe-pwes]]* means "who distributes fish". *Pwes* appears to be an archaic form of *[[Xiri dictionary#fes|fes]]* "river fish", possibly loaned from an early derivative of the [[Proto-Azodoan language]] which is believed to have used protruded bilabial consonants such as [pʷ]. It may otherwise be the result of metathesis of an older *\*f-ape-w-pes*, with the collective plural prefix *[[Xiri dictionary#u-|u-]]* appearing as a semivowel *w-*. The name was remodelled with the collective plural in this way in [[Xiri#Late Xiri|Late Xiri]], yielding *[[Xiri dictionary#fabeubes|fabeubes]]*.

In [[Möxali]], they are called *[[Möxali dictionary#böbis|Böbis]]*, one of the six [[Zívon|lunar months]] of the [[Öcídñox]] calendar.
