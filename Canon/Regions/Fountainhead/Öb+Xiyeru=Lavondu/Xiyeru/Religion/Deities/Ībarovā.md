**Ībarovā** are a set of 16 primordial celestial deities in [[Xiyeru religion|Xiyeru mythology]], responsible for the creation and development of the world. By the time of the [[Xiyeru]], the ībarovā were considered to be essentially dormant and only performed maintenance duties, with the [[sārovā]], lesser spirits, taking on more active roles in daily life.

# Generations

## First generation

The first and most primordial being in the universe was [[Fururūʼupwa]], the god of the sun, the day-time sky, humanity, and unity-in-infinity, from whom three more genderless deities emerged. According to the most common account, [[Fururūʼupwa]] split into four aspects simultaneously, though the three secondary "spirits" or "minds" take a subordinate role, and in certain older traditions they are described as emerging sequentially and are sometimes called the first children of [[Fururūʼupwa]]:

- **[[Faraʼeība]]** — "Who burns the sky", god of light, the night-time sky, fate, and ultimate destruction.
- **[[Fadanaūmu]]** — "Who leads the water", god of time, water, children, and procreation.
- **[[Fayobozimi]]** — "Who rules the stars", god of the ground, astronomy, geometry, construction and destruction (particularly of villages), and leadership.

These ībarovā played important parts in the [[Xiyeru creation story]], and each was a custodian of one of the three [[ūžāraza]], the fundamental substances from which the world is composed.

## Second generation

After the creation of the universe and the planet [[Winter]] in the first two chapters of the [[Xiyeru creation story|creation]], the second generation of ībarovā appeared. Some traditions held that they each split from one of the first children, with whom they then formed loving partnerships and bore children of their own. The pairs of first and second children were described as mirror images or opposing or complementary aspects of the same cosmic forces:

- **[[Fazegiri]]** — "Who gives the gift of language", god of language, storytelling, darkness, and justice.
- **[[Fabepwes]]** — "Who distributes fish", god of fishing, fortune, history, and journeys, particularly maritime voyages.
- **[[Famenekwi]]** — "Who cultivates yams", god of yams, harvest, accounting, and sound.

The second generation each contributed an important facet of human life and [[Xiyeru]] culture, namely language, fish and yams respectively.

Unlike the first generation, the three ībarovā of the second generation were gendered, and in the [[Azodo]] tradition, their emergence induced the first children to also take on aspects of the [[Xiyeru#Gender|three genders recognised by the Xiyeru]].

## Third generation

The third generation are the children of the first and second generations, each couple also bearing one offspring of each of the [[Xiyeru#Gender|three genders]]. The third generation of ībarovā also took part in less fundamental parts of [[Xiyeru creation story|creation]], most notably the creation of the [[Winter#Moons|moons of Winter]] by the grandsons of [[Fururūʼupwa]].
