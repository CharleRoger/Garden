**Faraʼeība** is one of the [[ībarovā]], celestial creator deities in [[Xiyeru religion]], associated with the planet [[Rubroplano]].

# Mythology

Faraʼeība was one of the first three [[ībarovā]] to emerge from [[Fururūʼupwa]] in the [[Xiyeru creation story#The early universe|early universe]] and is credited with creating light and filling the universe with it, the first deliberate act of creation. As such, they were primarily the god of light and the night-time sky, but were also known as the patron deity of fate and ultimate destruction.

During the creation of the planet [[Winter]], they created fire and volcanoes and became the custodian of [[Ūžāraza#Types|ībaraza]], one of the [[Ūžāraza|fundamental substances of the universe]].

Faraʼeība bore three children with [[Fazegiri]]: **[[Āwirō]]**, **[[Āhiñu]]** and **[[Āraʼe]]**.

# Name

The name *[[Xiri dictionary#faraʼeība|fa-raʼe-ība]]* means "who burns the sky", in reference to their creation of light and perhaps inspired by the appearance of the bright planet [[Rubroplano]] as the first "star" in the sky at dusk.

In [[Möxali]], they are called *[[Möxali dictionary#daqíb|Daqib]]*, one of the six [[Zívon|lunar months]] of the [[Öcídñox]] calendar.
