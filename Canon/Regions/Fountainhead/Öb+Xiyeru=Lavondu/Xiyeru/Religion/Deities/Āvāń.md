**Āvāń** "Great-[[Bigmoon]]" is one of the nine third-generation [[ībarovā]] and the son of [[Fadanaūmu]] and [[Fabepwes]] in [[Xiyeru religion|Xiyeru mythology]].

He is the patron deity of [[Bigmoon]], the ocean, sailing, good fortune, and the changing of the seasons.

# Role in creation

In the [[Xiyeru creation story]], Āvāń created a large world in the skies of [[Winter]] and brashly flooded it with water, leaving no land for people to live. [[Fururūʼupwa]] banished Āvāń into the core of his failed world, [[Bigmoon]], to act as an eternal warden of [[Winter]] in conjunction with [[Smallmoon]] (*See: [[Fururūʼupwa#Eye of Fururūʼupwa]]*).
