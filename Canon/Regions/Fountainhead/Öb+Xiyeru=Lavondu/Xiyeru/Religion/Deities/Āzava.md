# Role in creation

In the [[Xiyeru creation story]], Āzava created a massive new world in the skies of [[Winter]] which fell into the ocean and sank, dragging him down with it and drowning him. After becoming the first being to die in the universe, he was said to have resided in a cave deep within the core of the planet and cursed all life on [[Winter]] to mortality for the rest of time. The planet [[Winter]] is characterised by the presence of death as the only mortal realm in [[Xiyeru religion#Cosmology|Xiyeru cosmology]].
