**Fururūʼupwa** is the universal creator deity and primordial being in [[Xiyeru religion]], associated with the [[sun]] and the day-time sky.

# Mythology

Among the variety of folklore traditions in [[Udovuʼo]], Fururūʼupwa was unanimously described as a genderless being of impossible physical form, with the closest possible approximation of their true form being an infinitely large body covered with tattoos that depict the entirety of the universe's creation, history and infinite possible future trajectories. The [[sun]] was considered to be the only physical manifestation of Fururūʼupwa.

Fururūʼupwa was said to have created the [[Ūžāraza|fundamental substances of the universe]] and used them to create the planet [[Winter]] from land and sea, as well as the firmament which contains the atmosphere, hosts the celestial bodies, and separates the physical world from [[Tanuswība]], the realm of pure light. They were also the creator of the first humans [[Kiyeru]] and [[Ńiyeru]] and thus were considered the patron deity of humanity.

## Children of Fururūʼupwa

Fururūʼupwa also created, or passively gave rise to, the first other conscious entities in the universe, called the [[ībarovā]]. The first six of the 16 [[ībarovā]] are the so-called "children" of Fururūʼupwa and are associated with the [[Solar system#Planets|visible planets]].

The first generation of [[ībarovā]] are each associated with an inferior planet.

- **[[Fayobozimi]]** — [[Pharon]]
- **[[Fadanaūmu]]** — [[Scoria]]
- **[[Faraʼeība]]** — [[Rubroplano]]

The second children are sometimes said to have split from the first generation, while other traditions hold that they also emerged from Fururūʼupwa directly. They are each associated with a superior planet:

- **[[Fazegiri]]** — [[Tünd]]
- **[[Fabepwes]]** — [[Gomb]]
- **[[Famenekwi]]** — [[Fleck]]

## Eye of Fururūʼupwa

The eye of Fururūʼupwa ([[Xiri]]: *Fururūʼupwaže wiʼi*) was a name given to the conjunction of the [[Winter#Moons|moons of Winter]], which was considered to take on the appearance of an eye when the darker [[Smallmoon]] passed in front of the brighter [[Bigmoon]]. This takes place approximately every 12 days and marks the end of the 12-day market week.

The [[Xiyeru creation story]] recounts that the moons were formed as failed attempts to create living worlds by the grandsons of [[Fururūʼupwa]]: [[Āvāń]], who created [[Bigmoon]]; [[Āhiñu]], who created [[Smallmoon]]; and [[Āzava]], who created a world so large it fell from the sky and drowned him in the ocean. [[Fururūʼupwa]] created the eye as a punishment for the surviving two grandsons and to act as an eternal warden to surveil the planet [[Winter]].

# Name

The name *[[Xiri dictionary#fururūʼupwa|f-uru-rūʼu-pwa]]* literally means "who forms the sea and land" and is an example of a *[[Ńuʼu#Mūʼojūńuʼu|mūʼojūńuʼu]]*, a "forever name" granted to individuals in honour of lifetime achievements and to refer to them after death, which were usually sentence names of a similar form. The [[Xiyeru]] acknowledged, however, that Fururūʼupwa was immortal and that their true name must have been, like their body, unknowable, infinitely long and essentially just a description of everything that has ever happened and can possibly ever happen, so *Fururūʼupwa* was simply a short epithet. 

Fururūʼupwa is the most widely written name in the history of  [[Udovuʼo]], spanning the entire history of writing on the islands, even apparently appearing in the earliest petroglyphic proto-writing.
