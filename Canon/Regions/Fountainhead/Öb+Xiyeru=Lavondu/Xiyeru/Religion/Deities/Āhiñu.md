**Āhiñu** "Great-[[Smallmoon]]" is one of the nine third-generation [[ībarovā]] and the son of [[Faraʼeība]] and [[Fazegiri]] in [[Xiyeru religion|Xiyeru mythology]].

He is the patron deity of [[Smallmoon]], [[Ńaʼay|tattoos]], and writing.

# Role in creation

In the [[Xiyeru creation story]], Āhiñu carefully created a modest world in the skies of [[Winter]], but accidentally burnt it to ash in an attempt to breathe life into it, as [[Fururūʼupwa]] had done with [[Winter]]. [[Fururūʼupwa]] banished Āhiñu into the core of his failed world, [[Smallmoon]], to act as an eternal warden of [[Winter]] in conjunction with [[Bigmoon]] (*See: [[Fururūʼupwa#Eye of Fururūʼupwa]]*).
