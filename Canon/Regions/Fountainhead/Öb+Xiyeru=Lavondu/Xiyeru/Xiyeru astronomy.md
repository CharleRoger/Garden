# Astronomical objects
## Moons
[[Bigmoon]] and [[Smallmoon]], called *Fāń* and *Hiñu* in [[Xiri]], were the most important objects in the night sky to the [[Xiyeru]]. Their periodic phase changes and conjunctions formed the basis of their 12-day week, 64-day month and 385-day [[Xiyeru calendars|double-lunar calendar]] and the later, [[Lavondu]]-developed [[Öcídñox]] calendar.

The [[Xiyeru]] considered [[Bigmoon]] to have sixteen distinct phases, called *uvāń*. These were of particular importance, since [[Bigmoon|Bigmoon's]] variable brightness greatly affected the behaviour of sea life and thus indicated optimum times to hunt for certain fish, as well as providing light which aided navigation both on land and at sea.
## Stars
[[Xiyeru]] ancestral wisdom held that stars were holes punctured in the firmament by the ascension of certain individuals' [[Xiyeru#Parts of the self|rhovā]] (spirit) upon death to [[Xiyeru cosmology#Tanuswība|Tanuswība]], the ultimate layer of the universe in [[Xiyeru cosmology]], lying above the celestial sphere. The brightness of a star corresponded to the potency of the person's [[Xiyeru#Living spirit and legacy spirit|mūʼoru]] (spiritual legacy), with the brightest stars associated with the most legendary figures in [[Xiyeru#Religion|Xiyeru folklore]] and the vast majority of people's [[Xiyeru#Parts of the self|rhovā]] remaining in the air and not forming stars. The first woman and man for example, [[Xiyeru creation story|Kiyeru and Ńiyeru]], were associated with the second and fourth brightest stars, a close pair in the northern sky, often called *Uvōmeru* "the spouses".
### The Glob
[[The Glob]], the large accumulation of stars towards the centre of the [[solar system]]'s host globular cluster, contains the vast majority of visible stars in the sky, situated near the celestial south pole. The [[Xiyeru]] associated [[the Glob]] with the [[Xiyeru#Tarodaroeru|Tarodaroeru]] "ancient-people", said to be the first civilised population who lived in [[Udovuʼo]] c. 4000 BGS according to historical tradition. Among [[the Glob]] is the brightest star in the sky, which had several names, but was most often simply called *Āzimi* "great-star", attributed to the first [[Āeruweʼa]], the de facto founder of the [[Xiyeru|Xiyeru culture]].
### Ancestor stars
With the exception of some particularly bright stars like the spouses, the few thousand stars not identified with [[the Glob]] are interpreted as belonging to more recent [[Xiyeru]] ancestors and are an important part of [[Xiyeru#Religion|familial ancestor worship]]. Every [[Xiyeru#Families|Xiyeru family]] would have one or several stars which they associated with some known ancestors.
## Planets
The Xiyeru recognised the typical set of six visible [[Solar system#Planets|planets]], three inferior and three superior, and considered them distinct from the fixed stars due to their periodic motion across the sky. The [[Solar system#Planets|planets]] were therefore not considered holes in the firmament, but manifestations of non-human celestial beings moving around beneath it. [[Fururūʼupwa]], the creator of the land, sea, and the first people, is said to have become the sun, while the six planets are remnants of other deities who each played their own role in creation.

The inferior planets took part in the design of the universe itself:
- *Fayobozimi* "who rules the stars" ([[Pharon]]), brought the spirits of the deceased up to [[Xiyeru cosmology#Tanuswība|Tanuswība]], creating and arranging stars into meaningful patterns for later people to observe.
- *Fadanaūmu* "who leads the water" ([[Scoria]]), created the first rivers, ocean swells, and the flow of time. Considered in some way responsible for the birth of the first child of [[Xiyeru creation story|Kiyeru and Ńiyeru]].
- *Faraʼeība* "who burns the sky" ([[Rubroplano]]), created fire and light, becoming the first entity to appear in the night sky before the other deities followed suit.

While the superior planets each contributed some important element of human life:
- *Fazegiri* "who gives language" ([[Tünd]]), granted humanity the ability to speak, separating them from the animals.
- *Fabeubes* or *Fabepwes* "who distributes fish" ([[Gomb]]), filled the rivers and seas with animal life.
- *Famenekwi* "who cultivates yams" ([[Fleck]]), created yams and taught the first people how to cultivate crops. Conversely, rice is considered a much later innovation by the [[Xiyeru#Tarodaroeru|Tarodaroeru]], using techniques learnt from Famenekwi.
# Astrometry
[[Xiyeru]] astronomers divided the night sky into *[[Xiyeru units of measurement#Angular sections|uriži]]*, sixteen slices each called a *[[Xiyeru units of measurement#Angular sections|rhiži]]*. Each [[Xiyeru units of measurement#Angular sections|rhiži]] had a representative constellation, together forming a zodiac-like band across the ecliptic known as the *Āviwinēs (ībaže)* "great ring road (of the sky)". As the sun, moons and planets move through the sky, they move through the sixteen constellations of the Āviwinēs.

A long-standing convention held that astronomical measurements of stars and planets should not be made until one [[Xiyeru units of measurement#Angular sections|rhiži]] (90 minutes) had passed since sunset, and should not be made less than one [[Xiyeru units of measurement#Angular sections|rhiži]] before sunrise, leaving six [[Xiyeru units of measurement#Angular sections|rhiži]] (nine hours) of good observing time. This ensured that the night sky was as dark as possible, not polluted by the glow of dawn or dusk. Such measurements were taken at sea-level with a clear view of the ocean horizon, from which the ascension of the star was measured using simple trigonometric instruments.

The [[Xiyeru]] considered each star to have a certain day of first appearance in the [[Xiyeru calendars#Solar year|solar year]], the day on which it can first be properly observed according to the aforementioned convention. To understand this, here's a bit of astronomical background:
- Stars, planets and moons rise in the east and set in the west, like the sun.
- As [[Winter]] travels along its orbit, the observed relative position of the sun against the "fixed" background of stars in the sky appears to change.
- This annual motion means that any given star will rise and set earlier and earlier in the night as the year progresses, until it sets so early that it is not seen at night since it just sets with the sun.
- After 20-30 days the sun and the star will have moved far enough apart in the sky for it to be visible at night again, and it will be seen to rise just before the sun.

Thus, a star's canonical day of *aʼe* "arrival" is when it rises exactly one [[Xiyeru units of measurement#Angular sections|rhiži]] before sunrise. The star then remains in the night sky, though at varying times, for precisely 220 days, after which it has a final proper appearance one [[Xiyeru units of measurement#Angular sections|rhiži]] after sunset on its day of *ega* "departure" before disappearing into the dusk over the next few days. Most stars actually become visible a few days before their canonical arrival date, allowing astronomers to prepare for the first official observation when the time comes.
## Messenger stars
Certain bright stars served a special calendrical purpose, as their arrival happened to land on days of astronomical significance. Messenger stars were used to coordinate [[Xiyeru calendars#Annual festivals|annual festivals]] and calibrate other astronomical measurements. Note that the solstices and equinoxes mentioned below refer to the seasons experienced in the southern hemisphere.

Some notable messenger stars include:
- *Āzimi* "great star" — The brightest star in the sky, arriving on the 57th day of the year and heralding the spring equinox six days later, and the associated [[Xiyeru calendars#Annual festivals|Ñārujū]] festival.
- *Uvōmeru* "the spouses" — The wife and husband stars arrived in the sky on the 128th and 131st days of the year respectively, just after the summer solstice on the 125th day and thus were used to coordinate the [[Xiyeru calendars#Annual festivals|summer solstice festival]].
- *Kabahāraru* "confident sailor" — The third brightest star in the sky, which indicated the [[Xiyeru calendars#Annual festivals|autumnal equinox]] on the 188th or 189th day.
- *Naʼa tože* "door of the house" — The ninth brightest star, which signalled the imminent winter solstice and thus the start of a new [[Xiyeru calendars#Solar year|solar year]].
