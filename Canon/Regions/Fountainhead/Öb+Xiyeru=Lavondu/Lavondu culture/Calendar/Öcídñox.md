The **Öcídñox** or **Lavondu calendar** is a lunar calendar used by by several cultures throughout history, originally developed as part of [[Tuvöblin]] in the 850s [[Universal calendar|AGS]] but based on much older [[Xiyeru]] systems.
# Etymology
The original [[Möxali]] name for the calendar, *öcídñox*, roughly means "sacred counted cycle", and can be broken down as follows:
- *öci* — verb stem "count days, measure time", from [[Low Alöbi]] *öcwin*
- *-d(a)* — subordination suffix
- *-n-* — dummy noun root
- *-yox* — reverential classifier
This word commonly appears in the [[Möxali#Outer Möxali|Outer Möxali]] dialectal form *öcízñox*. The calendar can also colloquially be referred to as *öcídnö* or *öcíznö* with *-ö* the classifier for cyclic things, which is more properly the name of the 1540-day major unit of the calendar.
# History
In 855 [[Universal calendar|AGS]], [[Lavondu]] astronomers in [[T'ugü]] completed the construction of a 1540-day calendrical system as part of the re-establishment of the [[Nejinayon]] historical tradition. Its primary purpose was to attach dates to historical records, but also aided astronomical observation and general timekeeping. It was based on traditional [[Xiyeru]] lunar calendars and designed to function for long periods of time without manual correction.

Many calendrical systems were developed by the [[Xiyeru]] for different purposes throughout history. There have been several lunar calendars which track the position of [[Winter#Moons|both moons]] as they move through a set of constellations, similar to the zodiac, in order to aid navigation at sea. There is no appreciable variation in weather, temperature or life in general throughout the (251.8-day) solar year in [[Udovuʼo]], so solar calendars were not used that much. The [[Xiyeru]] did know of the 251.8-day sidereal motion of the [[sun]] across the sky, had measured it precisely, and had incorporated it into some navigational calendars. The primary timekeeping calendar in [[Udovuʼo]] was a 385-day lunar calendar based on the phases and conjunctions of [[Winter#Moons|both moons]], and it was this calendar that formed the basis of the Öcídñox.

Since the Öcídñox was developed by the [[Lavondu]] and was primarily used in [[T'ugü]], the terminology of the canonical form and of this article are in the [[Möxali]] language. Use of the calendar also quickly spread throughout [[Udovuʼo]] where equivalent [[Ahōtoli]] terminology was used, often derived from the same traditional [[Xiri]] as the [[Möxali]] terms.
# Structure
The calendar is composed of several cycles of different lengths based on the motion and phases of the [[Winter#Moons|moons of Winter]], listed below:
- [[Qíñu]] — 10-day synodic cycle of [[Smallmoon]].
- [[Víqin]] — 12-day conjunction cycle of the [[Winter#Moons|two moons]].
- [[Zívon]] — 64-day synodic cycle of [[Bigmoon]], whose phases are known as [[uvon]].
From these three natural cycles, other calendrical units are constructed:
- [[Zívon#Bigídne|Bigídne]] — 4-day period representing a single [[uvon]] phase of [[Bigmoon]].
- [[Zívon#Uvíne|Uvíne]] — 16-day quarter of a [[zívon]].
- [[Qíñu#Xínen|Xínen]] — 77-day cycle to account for ~0.13109 day accumulated error in each [[qíñu]] cycle.
- [[Újnö]] — 385-day astrophysical cycle equalling six synodic cycles of [[Bigmoon]], 16 cycles of lunar conjunctions and 19 synodic cycles of [[Smallmoon]].
- Öcídnö — 1540-day cycle of four [[újnö]].

## Physical origin
The 1540-day complete cycle of the calendar is based on the fact that in 385 days, almost exactly six synodic [[uvon]] cycles of [[Bigmoon]] (6 × 64.1647 = 384.9882) and almost exactly 38 synodic [[qíñu]] cycles of [[Smallmoon]] (38 × 10.13109 = 384.98142) occur. This is due to an apparent ~19:3 resonance between the synodic cycles of the [[Winter#Moons|moons]], i.e. that three [[uvon]] cycles almost exactly equals 19 [[qíñu]] cycles. This is not entirely a coincidence, rather it is a secondary result of more complex orbital configuration involving the planet [[Pharon]].
## Savon
The ~1 day misalignment between the physical cycle (1 [[újnö]] = 385 days) and the calendar cycle (six [[zívon]] = 384 days) means that the day of [[uvon]] slips forward every 6 [[zívon]]. Consider the example below:
- A [[zívon]] begins with the moons new and in conjunction on its first day, this marks the start of the [[újnö]] and so the [[uvon]] will land on [[Zívon#Bigídne|Tande]] (the first day) of each [[Zívon#Bigídne|bigídne]].
- After 385 days (6 [[zívon]] + 1 day), the next [[újnö]] begins with the new moon conjunction on [[Uvon#Lunar phases|Xuvñúja]] [[Zívon#Bigídne|Inpi]] the second day of the [[zívon]], and each [[uvon]] then continues to land on [[Zívon#Bigídne|Inpi]] every four days.
- After another 385 days, the [[újnö]] begins on the third day, [[Zívon#Bigídne|Ozbi]], and so on.
- After 4 [[újnö]], the [[uvon]] would have slipped forwards four days and into [[Uvon#Lunar phases|Yubñon]], the next [[Zívon#Bigídne|bigídne]], but this is prevented by intercalation.
- After a total of 1536 days has passed, the final [[Zívon#Bigídne|bigídne]], [[Uvon#Lunar phases|Yuben]], has its [[uvon]] at the very end of its fourth day ([[Uvon#Lunar phases|Yobinja]] [[Zívon#Bigídne|Ozbi]]). Four days are then inserted to ensure the following [[Zívon#Bigídne|bigídne]] [[Uvon#Lunar phases|Xúvñu]] has its [[uvon]] land at the very start of its first day ([[Uvon#Lunar phases|Xuvñúja]] [[Zívon#Bigídne|Tande]]). Since this intercalary period bears no [[uvon]], it is not a [[Zívon#Bigídne|bigídne]] and is instead called *Savon* "[[uvon]]-less".
- The four-day long Savon is inserted after every 24 [[zívon]] (1536 days), thereby completing the 1540-day, four-[[újnö]], *öcídnö* cycle.
## Greater timescales
Even with the Savon, the calendar is not perfect. The 152 [[Qíñu#Xínen|xínen]] cycles (1539.926 days) in the full öcídnö are so close to equalling the 128 [[víqin]] cycles (1539.921 days), that they actually remain synchronised with each other for over a thousand years. However, they are ~0.074-0.079 days shorter than the 1540-day calendar. This discrepancy was measured by the [[Lavondu]], but at the limit of the precision of their astronomy, having measured both as 0.075 days by the determination that the cycles would each lose 3 days in every 40 öcídnö (61,600 days).

[[Bigmoon]] also needs long-term correction, since 24 × 64.1647 = 1539.953 days, ~0.047 days shorter than the öcídñox. This was measured as 0.050 days (2 days in 40 öcídnö). Both of these errors are corrected using a 40-öcídnö cycle. The third [[Qíñu#Xínen|xínen]] day is removed from each of the 7th, 20th and 33rd öcídnö, and a day is removed from the Savon of the 10th and 30th öcídnö. The removal of these five days yields a 61,595-day cycle (about 245 years). With these final intercalation steps introduced in the [[10th century]], all cycles are brought back into alignment with the 1540-day öcídnö for over 2000 years, which is longer than the [[Qíñu#Xínen|xínen]] and [[víqin]] even remain synchronised with each other.
# Dates
Öcídnö cycles are numbered from the beginning of each [[Lavondu]] [[Nejinayon|historical period]]. Dates are recorded as strings of genitives preceding the smallest relevant calendrical unit. For example, the following full date of a day in 855 [[Universal calendar|AGS]]:
> *Eganja Vibínifsíja Ozbíja Yobzínja Duzúnja Sipö*
> `iga    -n  -ja   víbi -nífös-ö  -ja   ozbi-ja   yubzim-ja   dúz  ~u   -n   -ja   sepö`
> `depart-NMLZ-GEN  2.add-30   -CLF-GEN  4th -GEN  Yubzim-GEN  carve~PROG-NMLZ-GEN  3rd`
