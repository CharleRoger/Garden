**Víqin** is the [[Möxali]] name for the conjunction of the [[Moons of Winter]] which occurs approximately every 12 days. This is a day of various cultural observances for the [[Xiyeru]] and [[Lavondu]].
# Etymology
*Víqin* literally means "watching" or "observation". It is a nominalised form of the progressive verb *víqi* "watch, observe", ultimately from [[Xiri]] *fawiʼi* "see".

The proper full name of the event is *viqínja klusmö* "day of watching", calqued from the equivalent [[Xiri]] name *ūba wiʼiže*. This name may have been inspired by the appearance of the small dark [[Smallmoon]] passing in front of the larger, brighter [[Bigmoon]] sometimes resembling an eye. [[T'ugü]] is further from the equator than [[Udovuʼo]] and therefore further out of the moons' orbital plane, so when the moons do meet they are not as perfectly aligned and do not actually look much like an eye.
# Mechanics
The 10.19103 day orbit of [[Smallmoon]] and 64.1647 day orbit of [[Bigmoon]] mean that they occur in roughly the same position in the sky, thus having the same phase, every 12.11525 days. The two moons roughly lie in [[Winter|Winter's]] equatorial plane, so from equatorial regions on the planet, [[Smallmoon]] actually passes in front of [[Bigmoon]] during this conjunction.
# Cultural practices
## Xiyeru
In [[Xiyeru|Xiyeru culture]], Víqin symbolised the eye of [[Fururūʼupwa]] periodically looking over the world they created to check everything is in order. The day would be spent reflecting on the events of the past 12 days and preparing for the next 12. During the ~30 minutes it takes for [[Smallmoon]] to transit [[Bigmoon]], if it is visible, people would sing, dance and burn offerings to [[Fururūʼupwa]].
## Lavondu
To the [[Lavondu]], Víqin is the day on which regular meetings between family representatives and local politicians take place. The 12-day cycle is therefore important to the [[Zúnton|communication structure]] present throughout [[T'ugü]] and thus also to trade and distribution of commodities.

On the day of Víqin, [[Smallmoon|Smallmoon's]] phase is not considered to be one of the ten canonical [[qíñu]], but rather in a state of *Igun* "imitation" as it adopts the same phase as [[Bigmoon]].
