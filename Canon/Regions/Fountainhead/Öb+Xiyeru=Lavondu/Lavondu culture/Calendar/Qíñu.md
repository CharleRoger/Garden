**Qíñu** is the primary [[Möxali]] name for [[Smallmoon]] as an astronomical entity, and also refers to its 10-day synodic cycle of phases. Other names for the moon are used in other contexts, such as *inki*, the personified name of the moon used colloquially and in the retelling of [[Lavondu]] lore.
# Etymology
*Qíñu* comes from the [[Xiri]] name for [[Smallmoon]], *hiñu*. In the [[Möxali#Inner Möxali|Inner Möxali]] dialect spoke in [[T'ugü]], the initial glottal stop *q* [ʔ] is often elided in typical speech, while in the [[Möxali#Outer Möxali|Outer Möxali]] dialects it is never present and the word is typically spelt *íñu* or *iñu*.
# Lunar phases
Each of the 10 days of [[Smallmoon|Smallmoon's]] synodic cycle is given a name in the lunar calendars of the [[Xiyeru]] and [[Lavondu]], as well as many other cultures on [[Winter]]. The [[Möxali]] names for the ten phases are listed below:
1. *Mumö* "ghost" (new moon)
2. *Danök* "fishhook"
3. *Límen* "yoke"
4. *Jaki* "crab"
5. *Katpe* "tree stump"
6. *Túqon* "dinosaur egg" (full moon)
7. *Janib* "grindstone"
8. *Íbo* "gourd"
9. *Údok* "salamander"
10. *Cíben* "peelings"

# Xínen
[[Smallmoon|Smallmoon's]] synodic period is not exactly 10 days, but ~10.13109. This discrepancy accumulates one day of error every ~77 days. This is accounted for in the [[Öcídñox]] calendar by marking every 77th day as *Xínen* "pausing", where there is considered to be no qíñu that day. The cycle then picks up where it left off the day after. Xínen is a day of rest for all people who observe it, where trade, travel, religious ritual or work of any kind is taboo and in some cases prohibited by law. Xínen can be quite inconvenient, but it is at least predictable, so people respect it nonetheless. Note that the [[uvon]] cycle keeps ticking through Xínen, it is only the qíñu that is affected.
