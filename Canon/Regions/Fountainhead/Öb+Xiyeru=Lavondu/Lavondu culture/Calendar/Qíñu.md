**Qíñu** is the primary [[Möxali]] name for [[Smallmoon]] as an astronomical entity, and also refers to its 10-day synodic cycle of phases. Other names for the moon are used in other contexts, such as *inki*, the personified name of the moon used colloquially and in the retelling of [[Lavondu]] lore.
# Etymology
*Qíñu* comes from the [[Xiri]] name for [[Smallmoon]], *hiñu*. In the [[Möxali#Inner Möxali|Inner Möxali]] dialect spoke in [[T'ugü]], the initial glottal stop *q* [ʔ] is often elided in typical speech, while in the [[Möxali#Outer Möxali|Outer Möxali]] dialects it is never present and the word is typically spelt *íñu* or *iñu*.
# Lunar phases
Each of the 10 days of [[Smallmoon|Smallmoon's]] synodic cycle is given a name in the lunar calendars of the [[Xiyeru]] and [[Lavondu]], as well as many other cultures on [[Winter]]. The [[Möxali]] names for the ten phases are listed below:
1. *Mumö* "ghost" (new moon)
2. *Danök* "fishhook"
3. *Límen* "yoke"
4. *Jaki* "crab"
5. *Katpe* "tree stump"
6. *Túqon* "dinosaur egg" (full moon)
7. *Janib* "grindstone"
8. *Íbo* "gourd"
9. *Údok* "salamander"
