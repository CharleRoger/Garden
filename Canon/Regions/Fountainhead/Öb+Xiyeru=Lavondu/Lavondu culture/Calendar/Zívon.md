**Zívon** is the [[Möxali]] name of the 64-day lunar month in the [[Öcídñox]] lunar calendar used by the [[Lavondu]] and many other cultures, representing the 64.1647-day synodic cycle of [[Bigmoon]].
# Etymology
*Zívon* is a clipping of the [[Xiri]] *cazīvāń* "[[Bigmoon]] lunation", from *cazī* "change, progress" + *fāń* "(phase of) [[Bigmoon]]".
# Calendrics
The zívon is the central unit of the [[Öcídñox]] calendar, a 64-day month based on the synodic cycle of [[Bigmoon]].
## Bigídne
The zívon is divided into a fixed structure of 16 four-day periods called *bigídne* "bearing segment", named so because they each bear one of the 16 [[uvon]], the phases of [[Bigmoon]]. The bigídne are named for their [[uvon]], e.g. *Xuvñuja bigídne* "bigídne of Xúvñu" or less formally just *Xúvñu*. The four days in each bigídne are numbered using ordinal numerals derived from [[Xiri]], the only use of non-[[Öbic languages|Öbic]] numerals in [[Möxali]]:
1. *Tande* "first"
2. *Inpi* "second"
3. *Sipö* "third"
4. *Ozbi* "fourth"
## Uvíne
The zívon is also divided into four *uvíne* "great segments":
1. *Arin* "commencement"
2. *Acon* "arrival"
3. *Indin* "departure"
4. *Incon* "return" 

The uvíne do not align exactly with the bigídne, but rather are determined directly from the [[uvon]]. For example, the new moon can land on any of the four days of [[Uvon#Lunar phases|Xúvñu]], the 0th bigídne, and that day marks the transition from Incon to Arin and the beginning of a new zívon. This is because [[Bigmoon|Bigmoon's]] synodic period is not exactly 64 days, but ~64.1647. This means the positions of the [[uvon]] on the calendar changes by around a sixth of a day per zívon, and after six zívon will have shifted by a whole day. Since the uvíne is defined by the periods between certain [[uvon]], this means that every ~24th uvíne ends up 17 days in length. Note that despite this, the zívon is fixed at 64 days — the extra day accumulated every six zívon is accounted for in greater cycles of the calendar (see [[újnö]] and [[Öcídñox]]).

## Names
Zívon belong to a greater cycle approximately six times the length, called [[újnö]]. Each of the six zívon in this cycle are named after the six visible [[planets]], though any astronomical connection that might have inspired the names is not relevant to the calendar. The names used in [[Möxali]] derive from older [[Xiri]] names:
1. [[Pharos]] — *Yubzím* from [[Xiri]] *fayobozimi* "who rules the stars"
2. [[Scoria]] — *Danom*, from [[Xiri]] *fadanaūmu* "who leads the water"
3. [[Rubroplano]] — *Daqíb* from [[Xiri]] *faraʼeība* "who burns the sky"
4. [[Tünd]] — *Zindí*, from [[Xiri]] *fazegiri* "who gives tongue (language)"
5. [[Jotunn]] — *Böbis*, from [[Xiri]] *fabeubes* "who distributes fish"
6. [[Fleck]] — *Minkö*, from [[Xiri]] *famenekwi* "who cultivates yams"
