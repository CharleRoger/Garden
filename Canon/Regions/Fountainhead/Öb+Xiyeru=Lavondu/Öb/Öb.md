The **Öb** are a diverse group of [[Öboid]] peoples native to the [[T'ugü]] river basin.
# Prehistory
The Öb are believed to have lived in [[T'ugü]] since at least 10,000 [[Universal calendar|BGS]]. In the period before direct contact with cultures outside of [[T'ugü]], the Öb were mainly hunter gathers using stone tools and dugout canoes, and some animal husbandry techniques were developed. Within the last two millennia [[BGS]], speakers of an [[Upic languages|Upic language]] brought the [[Öbic languages|Alöbi]] language to [[T'ugü]], along with important technologies such as the wheel and basic agriculture of vegetables, though no cultivated grains. The main agricultural enterprise in [[T'ugü]], [[cimcim]] algaculture, was developed during this time.
# Cimcim algaculture
The Öb cultivate many varieties of a red macroalgae known as [[cimcim]] /ˈtʃimtʃim/, the staple food in [[T'ugü]]. The two main kinds of [[cimcim]] are [[cimcim#p'ila cimcim|p'ila cimcim]] "stringy cimcim" and [[cimcim#ökya cimcim|ökya cimcim]] "branching cimcim".

Öb in inland villages grow [[cimcim#p'ila cimcim|p'ila cimcim]] in shallow freshwater pools above the flood line and harvest it using a rake called a *tümog* /ˈtymoŋ/ "big hand". [[Cimcim]] pools are seeded and harvested on rotation on a timescale of 20-30 days in good weather. In the wet season, which sees reduced sunlight and generally poor conditions for working, the pools are typically seeded and left to mature for around 60-100 days, while the Öb adopt a lifestyle of reduced activity and diet and increased sleep.

[[cimcim#ökya cimcim|Ökya cimcim]] can be grown in fresh water, but most is grown in the shallow brackish water in the mouth of the river.

# Seasonal migration
The wet season brings strong winds, floods and perpetual fog which makes life in [[T'ugü]] difficult. Most Öb live in stilt houses near the river and just spend the season sleeping and eating, but some Öb choose to migrate around 200km into the hills. They would typically take whatever they can carry on their back and live off the land up there. Before they leave, the cimcim pools are seeded so that masses of the red algae can be harvested when they return. Some particularly better equipped Öb have special wagon houses called *k'ak'ohümi* /kʼɑkʼoxymi/ (literally "wooden giant snail" from *k'ak'oh* "giant snail" and *üm* "wood"). The biggest k'ak'ohümi can support a family of ~4. The wagons are pulled by [[ugo]], the only large domesticated animal in [[T'ugü]]. When they reach their destination, the wagon is emptied and the [[ugo]] is used to flip it upside down so that it can be used as a house until the rains pass.

# Culture and arts
The Öb in the larger settlements live comfortably with a good deal of free time, so many people spend a lot of that time making art in many media: wood carving, pottery, jewellery, carpets etc. They are particularly known for their dyed and intricately woven fabrics.
## Textiles
Öb have been weaving for thousands of years using hand-held looms and small wooden frame looms. The fibres of a grass called *jülem* are used to weave a textile similar to linen called *[[lilaw]]*, which was traditionally the only cloth available to the people of [[T'ugü]]. Weaving is a laborious process and a family might have one or two people who spend all their time weaving and stitching together clothes for everyone else.

Once the [[Xiyeru]] brought their sailing ships to [[T'ugü]], the Öb quickly saw how [[lilaw]] could be used in place of animal hide and leaves to make lighter, more durable sails. This also allows the construction of much larger sails and therefore much larger ships. To support this potential new industry and the developing trade economy, the backstrap loom was invented c. 600 [[Universal calendar|AGS]].

A backstrap loom uses the weight of the weaver's body to keep the threads in tension, which allows for large looms with very few parts to be easily set up and used. Weavers could now produce much larger pieces of cloth faster than they could before, establishing cloth production as an important new trade in [[T'ugü]].

As well as sails, faster and more advanced weaving allowed people to focus more on decorative patterns for clothes, carpets and other ornamental cloth.

## Dyes and pigments
Despite the narrow scope of natural resources available to the Öb early in their history, the manufacture and development of dyes and pigments became a prominent specialised trade for which [[T'ugü]] later became known. Dyes and pigments were traditionally produced in small quantities by individual artists and typically reduced to powders and stored in clay pots, and later in history this evolved into large-scale production and trade in some cases.

# Diversity
The Öb are a diverse continuum of language and culture, sometimes considered to include the [[Yaxeb]] peoples of [[Irimri]]. Four views of diversity within the Öb macroculture in [[T'ugü]] around [[Universal calendar|year 0]] are shown below:
