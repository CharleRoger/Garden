The **Öb** are a diverse group of [[Öboid]] peoples native to the [[T'ugü]] river basin.
# Prehistory
The Öb are believed to have lived in [[T'ugü]] since at least 10,000 BGS. In the period before direct contact with cultures outside of [[T'ugü]], the Öb were mainly hunter gathers using stone tools and [[Canoes in T'ugü|dugout canoes]], and some animal husbandry techniques were developed. Within the last two millennia BGS, speakers of an [[Upic languages|Upic language]] brought the [[Öbic languages|Alöbi]] language to [[T'ugü]], along with important technologies such as the wheel and basic agriculture of vegetables, though no cultivated grains. The main agricultural enterprise in [[T'ugü]], [[cimcim]] algaculture, was developed during this time.
# History
The first mention of Öb in recorded history in 67 AGS, when a contemporary [[Xiyeru]] almanac describes the discovery of [[T'ugü]] and first encounters with Öb people. It is fairly likely that the first contact actually happened some number of years earlier and took a while to become official canonical fact recorded in the historical records. Once the importance of this contact had been realised, the year 67 was retroactively marked as the beginning of the [[Horizon period]] in the [[Xiyeru]] and [[Lavondu]] historical tradition.

At this time, Öb society was extremely uncentralised, with no concept of political power, land ownership or anything of the sort. People lived off the land they happened to live on and there was not much trade of material possessions between families. Food was monotonous (like all aspects of life in [[T'ugü]]) but fairly plentiful. There were no means and no reason for anyone to leverage power over another person, there was just not much going on at all.

The following centuries saw a continued increase in contact and trade between [[T'ugü]] and [[Udovuʼo]], reaching a peak in the [[7th century]]. This ultimately led to the [[Exodus period#History|plague and famine of 655-644]] which triggered the [[Exodus period]], in which a vast number of [[Xiyeru]] refugees fled their [[Udovuʼo|home islands]] and permanently settled in [[T'ugü]]. Many Öb family leaders were able to quickly cement themselves in an important position in the developing society in [[T'ugü]], as providers of land and food. Despite [[cimcim]] being unpopular among the [[Xiyeru]], trading food (and later more luxurious goods) allowed the Öb who inhabited the populous coastal settlements to develop significant personal wealth and political power.

By 800 AGS, the traditional gift economies of [[T'ugü]] began to codify a system of common ownership on larger scales than were historically possible. Many families move away from farming and towards specialised trades as larger, interconnected communities are able to comfortably support themselves. [[Cimcim]] remained the most popular produce, though the typical diet of particularly people in the lowlands had a much greater variation of meat and vegetables, as well as rice.

The expanded permanent settlements throughout the lowlands drove out migratory people who would spend the dry season in those areas, and most of these people became essentially fully nomadic. [[T'ugü]] is not really big enough to support this lifestyle sustainably, so these people began to diffuse further into the hills, onto the [[Red Steppe]] and round the coast to the north. This was not a proper, large-scale migration out of [[T'ugü]], but represents the first known Öb to venture out into the rest of the world (which was totally unknown to anyone a few centuries ago).

In the late [[9th century]], the descendant population of the [[Xiyeru]] refugees flourished into the [[Lavondu]] culture, which also included a not-insignificant Öb population. The establishment of the first political institutions in [[T'ugü]] cemented collective resource ownership as a key principle of society, preventing what was a burgeoning wealth disparity from growing out of control. This had a profound effect on Öb society, with the introduction of the [[Zúnton]] resource distribution and management system turning almost every person in [[T'ugü]] into a citizen of a new communistic pseudo-state.

From around the [[10th century]] onwards, the Öb experienced an explosion of art and culture under the prosperity of [[Lavondu]] society. Öb were no longer an isolated cultural entity as they became absorbed into the widespread multicultural [[Lavondu]] society, of which [[T'ugü]] was the epicentre, allowing them to spread and draw influence from many other nations of [[Fountainhead]].
# Languages
Öb speak a continuum of languages known as [[Öbic languages]], a subgroup of the [[Upic languages]] which was brought to [[T'ugü]] by an unknown [[Upic peoples|Upic]] population within the last two millennia BGS, along with certain associated technology and cultural elements. The earliest attested [[Öbic languages]] were called *Alöbi*, an archaic term literally meaning "tongue of Öb". Alöbi dialects can be categorised into two distinct language groups: [[Low Alöbi]] and [[High Alöbi]], named so because they were generally spoken in the lowlands and highlands of [[T'ugü]] respectively throughout the first millennium AGS.

In the [[7th century]], The [[Low Alöbi]]-[[Xiri]] mixed language [[Möxali]] developed in bilingual communities of [[Xiyeru]] refugees. [[Möxali]] became the lingua franca in [[T'ugü]] and other parts of [[Fountainhead]] for many centuries, and was spoken by most [[Öb]] as a second language, first becoming popular in the [[9th century]].

[[Low Alöbi]] underwent a continuous evolution into the language which came to be known as [[Eubli]] from around the [[10th century]] onwards. [[Eubli]] is quite distinct from [[Low Alöbi]] in its vocabulary, phonology, grammar and writing, the result of several centuries of significant [[Möxali]] influence.
# Cimcim algaculture
The Öb cultivate many varieties of a red macroalgae known as [[cimcim]] /ˈtʃimtʃim/, the staple food in [[T'ugü]]. The two main kinds of [[cimcim]] are [[cimcim#p'ila cimcim|p'ila cimcim]] "stringy cimcim" and [[cimcim#ökya cimcim|ökya cimcim]] "branching cimcim".

Öb in inland villages grow [[cimcim#p'ila cimcim|p'ila cimcim]] in shallow freshwater pools above the flood line and harvest it using a rake called a *tümog* /ˈtymoŋ/ "big hand". [[Cimcim]] pools are seeded and harvested on rotation on a timescale of 20-30 days in good weather. In the wet season, which sees reduced sunlight and generally poor conditions for working, the pools are typically seeded and left to mature for around 60-100 days, while the Öb adopt a lifestyle of reduced activity and diet and increased sleep.

[[cimcim#ökya cimcim|Ökya cimcim]] can be grown in fresh water, but most is grown in the shallow brackish water in the mouth of the river.

## Skin reddening
A [[cimcim]]-heavy diet has the peculiar effect of turning the skin red, not by mere pigmentation, but by kleptoplasty. Red chloroplasts are reappropriated from the algae and show up in the lower layers of the skin. For most humans, [[cimcim]] is unpleasant to eat and causes sickness, and the kleptoplastic process can cause severe allergic reactions. The Öb, however, appear to have developed a generational resistance to it and can freely eat it without undesirable consequences. Despite what might be expected of a people native to a subtropical environment near the equator, Öb have a very pale natural skin tone, and it is believed that the [[cimcim]] actually helps to protect their otherwise vulnerable skin in much the same way as melanin. Öb with a high degree of [[cimcim]]-induced skin-reddening are actually able to indirectly photosynthesise a little bit by the metabolisation of the chloroplasts. An Öb in this condition still requires as much water as usual, but can last weeks with no food if they maintain low activity, until their skin returns to its natural pale colour as the chloroplast reserves are depleted.

# Society and lifestyle
The Öb peoples exhibit a range of different lifestyles in [[T'ugü]], [[Irimri]] and parts of the [[Red steppe]], from fully settled agriculturalists to semi-nomadic seasonal migratory pastoralists to fully nomadic hunter-gatherers.
## Bineb
The primary societal unit in [[T'ugü]] is called a [[bineb]], a family-village of 10-30 people, though later in history this number was sometimes significantly larger. The concept of the [[bineb]] applies to both settled and semi-nomadic peoples.
## Gift economy
Settled society in [[T'ugü]] revolves around the periodic exchange of gifts between family-oriented villages. This practice was significantly impacted by contact with the [[Xiyeru]] throughout the first millennium AGS, in which the exchange of resources particularly in areas near the coast became a more rigorous and much further-reaching trade network, exacerbated by the permanent settlement of [[Xiyeru]] refugees in [[T'ugü]] during the [[Exodus period]] and the creation of the [[Zúnton]] resource distribution and management system.

Travelling "merchants" became common in the lowlands of [[T'ugü]] by 800 AGS. These Öb had done away with the modest, old fashioned lifestyle still practised by the more rural people in favour of a life of whimsy and merriment. Such people were not exactly traders, but social ambassadors who give gifts to friendly, neighbouring communities. They often dressed in fanciful outfits and put on public displays of singing and dancing as they travelled from place to place, sometimes theatrically "bartering" with anyone whose attention they capture.

The illustration below shows such a gift-giver offering an assortment of fish which some of their family members had caught the day before:
![[fish man.png]]
From left to right: *jasi* (~catfish), *xlijek* (~eels), *bisek* (small oily fish, in the jars labelled BI-SE-KA), *t'ikyuek* ("knife fish"), *binem* (bitter fermented fish sauce, similar to garum).

Gift-givers like this travelled by [[ugo]] to a few nearby (but more isolated) villages a day in the dry season, distributing their goods and accepting anything that might be given in return. Their outfit is unique and personalised, made by their sibling using materials gained by trading which they would otherwise not have had easy access to.
## Husbandry and hunting
The only truly domesticated animal in [[T'ugü]] is the [[ugo]], a large, horned bovid-like animal. [[Ugo]] originate from the [[Red Steppe]] and are historically associated with the first settlement of [[T'ugü]] by the ancestors of the Öb, though this knowledge is long lost to them. Ugo are used mainly as a pack animal and general beast of burden, though their milk became popular in cooking after exposure to [[Xiyeru]] cuisine, which in particular led to [[ugo]] cheese becoming widely produced and consumed.
![[ugo 1.png]]

Many Öb, even in settled society, rely on the hunting of wild animals. Small mammals, birds, and bird-like dinosaurs such as the [[necwi]] and [[ombla]] are common game for an Öb hunter. A general rule followed in Öbic culture is that one should not eat from an animal larger than oneself, thus the [[ugo]] is never eaten. A related, smaller animal, the [[k'übi]], is often held and bred in captivity for its meat, hide and bones, though is not fully domesticated.

[[Togtog]] have been partially domesticated for a long time in [[T'ugü]]. [[Ugo]] can be too large and unwieldy for some jobs, so some people have historically tried to use [[togtog]] as a light-weight alternative, though they can be just as difficult to handle. Some time around 400-600 AGS, there was a bit more of a push towards domesticating them properly and people learn to ride the slightly bulkier males. By 800, [[togtog]] riders were common among the [[Öb]] who had migrated beyond [[T'ugü]] and onto the [[Red Steppe]]. The riders themselves dress as [[togtog|togtogs]] and are known as *üqqata* "split-headed", inspired by mythological two-headed creatures of the same name. They were mostly used as scouts when searching for places to settle or routes to trade through the mountains later on in history. *Bixka* (four-person) groups of üqqata were used to round up and hunt wild [[ikban]], which, now they could catch them, turned out to be a good source of food in the more desolate highlands.

## Seasonal migration
The wet season brings strong winds, floods and perpetual fog which makes life in [[T'ugü]] difficult. Most Öb live in stilt houses near the river and just spend the season sleeping and eating, but some Öb choose to migrate around 200km into the hills. They would typically take whatever they can carry on their back and live off the land up there. Before they leave, the cimcim pools are seeded so that masses of the red algae can be harvested when they return. Some particularly better equipped Öb have special wagon houses called *k'ak'ohümi* /kʼɑkʼoxymi/ (literally "wooden giant snail" from *k'ak'oh* "giant snail" and *üm* "wood"). The biggest k'ak'ohümi can support a family of ~4. The wagons are pulled by [[ugo]], the only large domesticated animal in [[T'ugü]]. When they reach their destination, the wagon is emptied and the [[ugo]] is used to flip it upside down so that it can be used as a house until the rains pass.

## Diversity
The Öb population is a diverse continuum of language and culture, sometimes considered to include the [[Yaxeb]] peoples of [[Irimri]]. Four views of diversity within the Öb macroculture in [[T'ugü]] around [[Universal calendar|year 0]] are shown below:
![[öb diversity in t'ugü.png]]
# Culture and arts
The Öb in the larger settlements live comfortably with a good deal of free time, so many people spend a lot of that time making art in many media: wood carving, pottery, jewellery, carpets etc. They are particularly known for their dyed and intricately woven fabrics.
## Textiles
Öb have been weaving for thousands of years using hand-held looms and small wooden frame looms. The fibres of a grass called *jülem* are used to weave a textile similar to linen called *[[lilaw]]*, which was traditionally the only cloth available to the people of [[T'ugü]]. Weaving is a laborious process and a family might have one or two people who spend all their time weaving and stitching together clothes for everyone else.

Once the [[Xiyeru]] brought their sailing ships to [[T'ugü]], the Öb quickly saw how [[lilaw]] could be used in place of animal hide and leaves to make lighter, more durable sails. This also allows the construction of much larger sails and therefore much larger ships. To support this potential new industry and the developing trade economy, the backstrap loom was invented c. 600 AGS.

A backstrap loom uses the weight of the weaver's body to keep the threads in tension, which allows for large looms with very few parts to be easily set up and used. Weavers could now produce much larger pieces of cloth faster than they could before, establishing cloth production as an important new trade in [[T'ugü]].

As well as sails, faster and more advanced weaving allowed people to focus more on decorative patterns for clothes, carpets and other ornamental cloth.

## Dyes and pigments
Despite the narrow scope of natural resources available to the Öb early in their history, the manufacture and development of dyes and pigments became a prominent specialised trade for which [[T'ugü]] later became known. Dyes and pigments were traditionally produced in small quantities by individual artists and typically reduced to powders and stored in clay pots, and later in history this evolved into large-scale production and trade in some cases.
(See: [[Öb dyes and pigments]])
## Jewellery
Jewellery is a less common craft in [[T'ugü]] which became more prominent through trade with the [[Xiyeru]] in the first few centuries AGS. The art of carving precious stones in particular developed significantly in the [[3rd century|3rd]] and [[4th century|4th]] centuries, exemplified by the pendant in the form of a frog shown below:
![[frog pendant combined.png]]
This pendant is ~4cm long and carved from a piece of a glassy, blue-green mineral called *klesik*~*tlisik*, a prolific precious stone found in T'ugü. Frogs symbolise innocence and goodwill in Öb culture and are a common subject in personal charms and artwork.
# Beliefs
Öb generally did not practise a religion as such, rather they had a rich history of [[Öb mythology|myths and folklore]].
## Yaloc
One of the most widespread beliefs characteristic of Öb culture is in Yaloc /jɑlotʃ/, a non-physical part of the self representing some essential life-force, present in all animals, distinguishing from them inanimate world, and considered responsible for emotion and thought. It is comparable to the [[Xiyeru]] *Rhova*, but belief in Yaloc was mostly a frivolous thing with most relevance as a folklore motif, not an ideological pillar, so had little influence on actual cultural practices. Yaloc is associated with the liver, generally considered the seat of emotions in the body. One [[Low Alöbi]] word for liver, *lüclüc*, might be derived from the same Proto-Öbic root *\*ruc* by the construction *lüc* < *\*rǖc* < *\*r⟨īw⟩uc*, where *\*⟨īw⟩* is an infix appearing on some other internal organs, e.g. *\*yīwen* "stomach", *\*tīwyuw* "bladder".

After contact with the [[Xiyeru]], some of these beliefs became more rigorously defined. A new word *Naidem* was coined (from *nayet* "thought") to distinguish the non-physical mind from the brain, considered by some to be part of the Yaloc, and by others a distinct entity. Other subconscious cognitive functions were thought to be handled by other parts of Yaloc and therefore other organs, which the Naidem was able to govern or communicate with. By the time of the emergence of the [[Lavondu]] culture, it was a common belief among the lowlands Öb that the Yaloc was a very real, though non-physical, complex of three or four parts, which informed the related [[Lavondu]] concept of [[Sviru]].
