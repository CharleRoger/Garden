The **Öb** are a diverse group of [[Öboid]] peoples native to the [[T'ugü]] river basin.
# Prehistory
The Öb are believed to have lived in [[T'ugü]] since at least 10,000 [[Universal calendar|BGS]]. In the period before direct contact with cultures outside of [[T'ugü]], the Öb were mainly hunter gathers using stone tools and dugout canoes, and some animal husbandry techniques were developed. Within the last two millennia [[BGS]], speakers of an [[Upic languages|Upic language]] brought the [[Öbic languages|Alöbi]] language to [[T'ugü]], along with important technologies such as the wheel and basic agriculture of vegetables, though no cultivated grains. The main agricultural enterprise in [[T'ugü]], [[cimcim]] algaculture, was developed during this time.
# Cimcim algaculture
The Öb cultivate many varieties of a red macroalgae known as [[cimcim]] /ˈtʃimtʃim/, the staple food in [[T'ugü]]. The two main kinds of [[cimcim]] are [[cimcim#p'ila cimcim|p'ila cimcim]] "stringy cimcim" and [[cimcim#ökya cimcim|ökya cimcim]] "branching cimcim".

Öb in inland villages grow [[cimcim#p'ila cimcim|p'ila cimcim]] in shallow freshwater pools above the flood line and harvest it using a rake called a _tümog_ /ˈtymoŋ/ "big hand". [[Cimcim]] pools are seeded and harvested on rotation on a timescale of 20-30 days in good weather. In the wet season, which sees reduced sunlight and generally poor conditions for working, the pools are typically seeded and left to mature for around 60-100 days, while the Öb adopt a lifestyle of reduced activity and diet and increased sleep.

[[cimcim#ökya cimcim|Ökya cimcim]] can be grown in fresh water, but most is grown in the shallow brackish water in the mouth of the river.

# Seasonal migration
The wet season brings strong winds, floods and perpetual fog which makes life in [[T'ugü]] difficult. Most Öb live in stilt houses near the river and just spend the season sleeping and eating, but some Öb choose to migrate around 200km into the hills. They would typically take whatever they can carry on their back and live off the land up there. Before they leave, the cimcim pools are seeded so that masses of the red algae can be harvested when they return. Some particularly better equipped Öb have special wagon houses called _k'ak'ohümi_ /kʼɑkʼoxymi/ (literally "wooden giant snail" from _k'ak'oh_ "giant snail" and _üm_ "wood"). The biggest k'ak'ohümi can support a family of ~4. The wagons are pulled by [[ugo]], the only large domesticated animal in [[T'ugü]]. When they reach their destination, the wagon is emptied and the [[ugo]] is used to flip it upside down so that it can be used as a house until the rains pass.
