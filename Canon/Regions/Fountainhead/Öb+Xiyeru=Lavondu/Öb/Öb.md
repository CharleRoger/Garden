The **Öb** are a diverse group of [[Öboid]] peoples native to the [[T'ugü]] river basin.
# Prehistory
The Öb are believed to have lived in [[T'ugü]] since at least 10,000 [[Universal calendar|BGS]]. In the period before direct contact with cultures outside of [[T'ugü]], the Öb were mainly hunter gathers using stone tools and [[Canoes in T'ugü|dugout canoes]], and some animal husbandry techniques were developed. Within the last two millennia [[BGS]], speakers of an [[Upic languages|Upic language]] brought the [[Öbic languages|Alöbi]] language to [[T'ugü]], along with important technologies such as the wheel and basic agriculture of vegetables, though no cultivated grains. The main agricultural enterprise in [[T'ugü]], [[cimcim]] algaculture, was developed during this time.
# Cimcim algaculture
The Öb cultivate many varieties of a red macroalgae known as [[cimcim]] /ˈtʃimtʃim/, the staple food in [[T'ugü]]. The two main kinds of [[cimcim]] are [[cimcim#p'ila cimcim|p'ila cimcim]] "stringy cimcim" and [[cimcim#ökya cimcim|ökya cimcim]] "branching cimcim".

Öb in inland villages grow [[cimcim#p'ila cimcim|p'ila cimcim]] in shallow freshwater pools above the flood line and harvest it using a rake called a *tümog* /ˈtymoŋ/ "big hand". [[Cimcim]] pools are seeded and harvested on rotation on a timescale of 20-30 days in good weather. In the wet season, which sees reduced sunlight and generally poor conditions for working, the pools are typically seeded and left to mature for around 60-100 days, while the Öb adopt a lifestyle of reduced activity and diet and increased sleep.

[[cimcim#ökya cimcim|Ökya cimcim]] can be grown in fresh water, but most is grown in the shallow brackish water in the mouth of the river.

# Society and lifestyle
The Öb peoples exhibit a range of different lifestyles in [[T'ugü]], [[Irimri]] and parts of the [[Red steppe]], from fully settled agriculturalists to semi-nomadic seasonal migratory pastoralists to fully nomadic hunter-gatherers.
## Bineb
The primary societal unit in [[T'ugü]] is called a [[bineb]], a family-village of 10-30 people, though later in history this number was sometimes significantly larger. The concept of the [[bineb]] applies to both settled and semi-nomadic peoples.
## Gift economy
Settled society in [[T'ugü]] revolves around the periodic exchange of gifts between family-oriented villages. This practice was significantly impacted by contact with the [[Xiyeru]] throughout the first millennium [[Universal calendar|AGS]], in which the exchange of resources particularly in areas near the coast became a more rigorous and much further-reaching trade network, exacerbated by the permanent settlement of [[Xiyeru]] refugees in [[T'ugü]] during the [[Exodus period]] and the creation of the [[Zúnton]] resource distribution and management system.

Travelling "merchants" became common in the lowlands of [[T'ugü]] by 800 AGS. These Öb had done away with the modest, old fashioned lifestyle still practised by the more rural people in favour of a life of whimsy and merriment. Such people were not exactly traders, but social ambassadors who give gifts to friendly, neighbouring communities. They often dressed in fanciful outfits and put on public displays of singing and dancing as they travelled from place to place, sometimes theatrically "bartering" with anyone whose attention they capture.

The illustration below shows such a gift-giver offering an assortment of fish which some of their family members had caught the day before:

From left to right: *jasi* (~catfish), *xlijek* (~eels), *bisek* (small oily fish, in the jars labelled BI-SE-KA), *t'ikyuek* ("knife fish"), *binem* (bitter fermented fish sauce, similar to garum).

Gift-givers like this travelled by [[ugo]] to a few nearby (but more isolated) villages a day in the dry season, distributing their goods and accepting anything that might be given in return. Their outfit is unique and personalised, made by their sibling using materials gained by trading which they would otherwise not have had easy access to.
## Seasonal migration
The wet season brings strong winds, floods and perpetual fog which makes life in [[T'ugü]] difficult. Most Öb live in stilt houses near the river and just spend the season sleeping and eating, but some Öb choose to migrate around 200km into the hills. They would typically take whatever they can carry on their back and live off the land up there. Before they leave, the cimcim pools are seeded so that masses of the red algae can be harvested when they return. Some particularly better equipped Öb have special wagon houses called *k'ak'ohümi* /kʼɑkʼoxymi/ (literally "wooden giant snail" from *k'ak'oh* "giant snail" and *üm* "wood"). The biggest k'ak'ohümi can support a family of ~4. The wagons are pulled by [[ugo]], the only large domesticated animal in [[T'ugü]]. When they reach their destination, the wagon is emptied and the [[ugo]] is used to flip it upside down so that it can be used as a house until the rains pass.

## Diversity
The Öb population is a diverse continuum of language and culture, sometimes considered to include the [[Yaxeb]] peoples of [[Irimri]]. Four views of diversity within the Öb macroculture in [[T'ugü]] around [[Universal calendar|year 0]] are shown below:

# Culture and arts
The Öb in the larger settlements live comfortably with a good deal of free time, so many people spend a lot of that time making art in many media: wood carving, pottery, jewellery, carpets etc. They are particularly known for their dyed and intricately woven fabrics.
## Textiles
Öb have been weaving for thousands of years using hand-held looms and small wooden frame looms. The fibres of a grass called *jülem* are used to weave a textile similar to linen called *[[lilaw]]*, which was traditionally the only cloth available to the people of [[T'ugü]]. Weaving is a laborious process and a family might have one or two people who spend all their time weaving and stitching together clothes for everyone else.

Once the [[Xiyeru]] brought their sailing ships to [[T'ugü]], the Öb quickly saw how [[lilaw]] could be used in place of animal hide and leaves to make lighter, more durable sails. This also allows the construction of much larger sails and therefore much larger ships. To support this potential new industry and the developing trade economy, the backstrap loom was invented c. 600 [[Universal calendar|AGS]].

A backstrap loom uses the weight of the weaver's body to keep the threads in tension, which allows for large looms with very few parts to be easily set up and used. Weavers could now produce much larger pieces of cloth faster than they could before, establishing cloth production as an important new trade in [[T'ugü]].

As well as sails, faster and more advanced weaving allowed people to focus more on decorative patterns for clothes, carpets and other ornamental cloth.

## Dyes and pigments
Despite the narrow scope of natural resources available to the Öb early in their history, the manufacture and development of dyes and pigments became a prominent specialised trade for which [[T'ugü]] later became known. Dyes and pigments were traditionally produced in small quantities by individual artists and typically reduced to powders and stored in clay pots, and later in history this evolved into large-scale production and trade in some cases.
(See: [[Öb dyes and pigments]])
## Jewellery
Jewellery is a less common craft in [[T'ugü]] which became more prominent through trade with the [[Xiyeru]] in the first few centuries [[Universal calendar|AGS]]. The art of carving precious stones in particular developed significantly in the [[3rd century|3rd]] and [[4th century|4th]] centuries, exemplified by the pendant in the form of a frog shown below:
![[frog pendant combined.png]]
This pendant is ~4cm long and carved from a piece of a glassy, blue-green mineral called *klesik*~*tlisik*, a prolific precious stone found in T'ugü. Frogs symbolise innocence and goodwill in Öb culture and are a common subject in personal charms and artwork.
