**Cimcim** is a family of many varieties of red macroalgae which grow naturally in [[Fountainhead]] and are cultivated in [[T'ugü]].
# Name
The name *cimcim* is a [[Low Alöbi]] term, a reduplication of a nominalised form of the adjective *cia* "red", thus literally meaning "red stuff". It was more broadly known throughout history as *jínjin*, the [[Möxali]] form of the name.
# P'ila cimcim
The most commonly eaten form of cimcim is known as *p'ila cimcim* in [[Low Alöbi]], meaning "stringy cimcim". P'ila cimcim naturally occurs in the river and forms masses of long knotted strands. High concentrations of spores from p'ila cimcim can turn the surrounding water pink. Fresh p'ila cimcim has an unpleasant texture so is usually boiled and added to soup or dried, powdered and baked into something resembling flat bread.
# Ökya cimcim
All other cimcim, including naturally occurring uncultivated forms, are called *ökya cimcim*, meaning "branching cimcim" in [[Low Alöbi]]. Ökya cimcim comes in many species of varying shape, taste and texture, many of which have been selectively bred by the [[Öb]]. This cimcim can be left to dry out to make a crispy salty snack or washed and eaten fresh.

# Algaculture
Both types of cimcim have been cultivated for millennia by the [[Öb]] in [[T'ugü]], where it is the primary staple food. (See: [[Öb#Cimcim algaculture]])
