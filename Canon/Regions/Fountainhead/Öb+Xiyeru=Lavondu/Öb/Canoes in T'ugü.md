Dugout canoes have been built by the [[Öb]] for perhaps as long as the culture has existed and may have been the mode of transport by which the first settlers arrived in [[T'ugü]].
# Construction
The traditional method of constructing a dugout canoe begins by felling a tree. Dry leaves and twigs are burnt at the base of a deciduous hardwood tree near the river and the burnt wood is cut away with a tool called an *anxub* in [[Low Alöbi]]. This process is repeated until the tree falls. The branches and bark are removed and the log is cut/burnt down to the desired size. The leaves are steamed to extract oil which is used as medicine and to treat wood.

The actual construction process is outlined below:

1. A groove is cut along the log and the cutting/burning technique is used to hollow out the log until it is sufficiently buoyant and stable. In order to slow the burning at the bottom and achieve a uniform thickness, the log is then rolled into the river where the cutting and burning continues to yield a hull a few centimetres thick. The burnt inner lining is hammered smooth using the blunt end of the anxub.
2. After the burning and adzing, the outside of the hull is carved into shape. The result is called a *xilub*. The natural oil in the wood makes it quite durable, but the xilub is usually treated with the oil extracted from the leaves to enhance the water resistance. A xilub is a fully functioning canoe and is usually used as is.
3. Larger canoes need to undergo an "opening" process which widens the hull to make the boat more stable. The opening is achieved by wedging stiff but bendy bamboo across the xilub and submerging the entire thing in a hot spring, weighed down by rocks, and leaving it overnight. The mineral content of the spring water whitens and slightly strengthens the wood. If no hot spring is available, the xilub is filled with water and special stones are periodically taken between a fire and the xilub to keep it boiling for several hours.
4. The widened xilub is called an *aga xilub*. Wooden planks are hammered in across the canoe to help it keep its shape and act as seats. The mineral-rich wood of an aga xilub is receptive to pigmentation and retains the colour well, so these canoes are often painted and decorated with carving.
Regular, unwidened xilub are ~3-4m long, ~0.4-0.6m wide and are typically used by [[Cimcim#P'ila cimcim|p'ila cimcim]] farmers, fisherman and [[Öb#Seasonal migration|seminomadic communities]] who live along the river. They tend to be used in shallow water where they can be propelled and steered by pushing and dragging a bamboo pole of a similar length to the xilub along the riverbed. Aga xilub can be significantly bigger, up to ~8m long and ~1m wide and are used for long distance voyages up and down the river, for example during migration. Since they are used in much deeper waters, they must be driven by paddle. A canoe like this may be used by a family for many years and can even be passed down several generations with enough maintenance.
# Sailing canoes
When the [[Xiyeru]] began to permanently settle along the northern coast of [[T'ugü]] in the [[Exodus period]], dugout canoes began to be used to build double-hulled [[Xiyeru sailing|Xiyeru sailing canoes]].
