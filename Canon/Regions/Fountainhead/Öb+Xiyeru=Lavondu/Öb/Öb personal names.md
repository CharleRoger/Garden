Personal names in [[T'ugü]] were historically quite a bit simpler than other traditions found around the Fountainhead coast, generally consisting of only two parts: **Noclo** and **Mölo**.
# Noclo
Noclo is the actual identifying name given to a person at birth by their parents, but can be changed later. Most common noclo names are disyllabic and don't have any meaning, e.g. *Tabin*, *Miyo* and *K'öbek*, while some ordinary but less common words have been established as names, e.g. *Iwbak* "herd of ungulates". In the first few centuries [[Universal calendar|AGS]], a trend of coining new names from stative-noun compounds emerged, e.g. *P'las-kilöb* "sparkling-treefrog", *Lawt-imim* "woven-cloud" and *K'iw-k'ixam* "hanging-spear". This opened up the class of noclo to allow for basically anything at all. Compound names are typically shortened to disyllabic nicknames in actual speech, either by just leaving the stative qualifier off or by some irregular modification, e.g. a person named *K'iw-k'ixam* might be known as *K'ik'i* informally.
# Mölo
Mölo is a generational name placed before the noclo when considering a person's full name, though the order is not actually important and can be switched sometimes. There are only five mölo:
  1. **Inklos** "the sun"
  2. **K'abah** "the mountains"
  3. **Böxök** "the river(land)s"
  4. **Guson** "the sea"
  5. **Wamcal** "the horizon" or **Wayam** "the firmament" (considered the same name, just regional variations)

The mölo are given to children in cyclic generations, e.g. a parent named *Guson Alo* may call their children *Wamcal Ci-bisek* and *Wamcal Mükmük*, and their children would take *Inklos* and so on. The mölo is important to the [[bineb]], the traditional communal unit of [[T'ugü]] society.

Note that the five generational names are not related to the [[Bineb#Mök'a bixay|mök'a bixay]] "the four quarters of aging" which describe a person's progression through life, but there is typically some effort made to keep the generations synchronised. This means that at any given time, most *int'ib* (children) within a bineb share a mölo, and most *ümök'* (young adults) also share a mölo, which may be the same as that of the children or the previous generational name, etc.

The mölo is used to inform the compatibility of two people wishing to form a [[klicet]], a type of marriage practised by the [[Öb]]. Marrying someone with the same mölo is forbidden, each of the five mölo have cultural associations (which are not taken too seriously), and there are common views about the 20 allowed marriage combinations too. For example, Böxök are often encouraged to marry Wamcal since such a pairing is said to bear many children, and marrying one step up or down the ladder is universally considered a good idea. The birth of any child is regarded as a time for new beginnings, but the first child to take the next mölo is especially revered as marking a spiritual clean slate for all people of the [[bineb]].
