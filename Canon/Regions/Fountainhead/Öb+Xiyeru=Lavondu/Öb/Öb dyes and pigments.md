Of the many dyes developed in [[T'ugü]], six have been particularly common for most of its history, shown applied to [[lilaw]] cloth in different concentrations in the illustration below. As well as these dyes, six common pigments are shown which don't chemically bind to cloth fibers like dye does, but can easily be mixed and are useful for making paints and temporarily colouring fabric.

These six dyes and six pigments are described below.
# Dyes
1. A vibrant pink dye made by crushing up a pink berry called *twimab*. Not particularly common, would take a while to get enough berries for something big like a carpet.
2. A spice called *k'ilunön* extracted from the root of a common plant called *k'unön* by peeling off the skin, drying it in the sun and crushing it up. It tastes similar to nutmeg or cinnamon and is often added to flat bread and curry, mostly for the colour.
3. Obviously, [[cimcim]] is the most common source of dye in [[T'ugü]]. The most common way to dye textiles is to leave them in water which has been used to grow [[Cimcim#P'ila cimcim|p'ila cimcim]], which gives it a faint pinkish hue. This is pretty much the only way people dye their clothes. Surplus [[Cimcim#P'ila cimcim|p'ila cimcim]] can also be boiled in salt water to yield a stronger red dye which still doesn't bind particularly well to [[lilaw]] but makes great red paint.
4. Simply the juice of a fruit called *banban*. It's a fairly effective yellow dye and can be concentrated by boiling to produce a darker red tone.
5. This dye is made by crushing up the whole head of a particular yellow flower called *hyoe* and leaving it to soak in water for a few days. A slightly more vibrant colour can be obtained by using saltier water. These flowers are found on a tree which is not particularly common, collecting enough of them to make any substantial amount of dye is quite labour intensive.
6. Made by filling a clay pot with any of a few varieties of mushrooms and water and leaving to ferment for a while. A fruit called *xület* is typically added to accelerate the fermentation process and yield a much darker colour.
# Pigments
7. A red pigment scraped off the surface of a glassy rock found in the mountains called _blixma acok'_ "shiny stone". Not easy to get hold of but an impressively deep red, even on [[lilaw]].
8. Red clay from the river. A popular clay used for pottery but also a nice rich brown pigment when dried out.
9. A drab pigment made from the coarse, sandy material filtered out of a kind of greenish soil.
10. Adding chalk powder to [[Cimcim#P'ila cimcim|p'ila cimcim]] boiling in fresh water yields a teal pigment which binds to the chalk. Super easy way of making an unusual colour, so is commonly used for paint.
11. A greyish lilac pigment made by crushing up the shells of a mollusc called _kincü_ which is commonly found in the river.
12. Plain old chalk, found all over T'ugü and called _löxök'_ in [[Low Alöbi]]. Pretty useless for cloth since it washes out so easily, but not bad for paint.
