**T'ugü** /tʼuŋy/ is a subtropical drainage basin set into the north west corner of [[Fountainhead]].

# Geography
The basin is about 300km across and has an area of around 50,000km². It is enclosed by ~1-3km tall mountains on the eastern and southern edges.

# Climate
The climate in the basin is fairly hot and humid with a mild monsoon in the summer. The low lying areas are particularly humid and much of the area around the river is swampy. The higher and drier land is mostly covered with subtropical evergreen forest. The forest in the outer hills is incredibly dense and untraveled while the inner hills in the west have been partially deforested and populated.
# Ecology
The wildlife of T'ugü is typical for the climate, in particular there are:
- Frogs and salamanders
- Snakes, lizards and [[sibig]]
- Large ungulates including [[ugo]], [[yunam]], [[k'übi]], [[mlomlo]]
- [[Wug]] species including [[cüo]], [[öxp'a]], [[togtog]] and [[ikban]]
- Small mammals including muntjacs, mustelids, flying squirrels, small primates, red pandas and something resembling pangolins
- ~50cm tall giant snails
- Two families of bird-like [[dinosaur|dinosaurs]] which are almost entirely unique to T'ugü
The river is home to many species of insects, crustaceans, catfish, eels, many other smaller fish species and birds which prey on them.

# Human population
The indigenous people of T'ugü, the [[Öb]], lived there for thousands of years before 67 AGS, the date traditionally given to the arrival of the [[Xiyeru]], the first recorded contact with outsiders. The vast majority of the [[Öb]] lived along the main part of the river, with the highest population density at the mouth. Building resources are became increasingly scarce as settlements grew throughout the [[1st millennium|1st]] and [[2nd millennium]], though food remained plentiful, so there was historically no reason to attempt the treacherous journey through the forested mountains to other lands.
