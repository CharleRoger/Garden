**Kōlăcetĭ** (785 - 880 AGS) was the governor of [[Azodo]] from 856 to 862.
# Political positions
## Early career
Kōlăcetĭ first began working in politics around 830, boasting an incredibly successful career in environmental ministerial roles spanning a few decades, coordinating civil engineering projects such as river bank fortification. 
## Lavondu independence
In 861, the [[Xiyeru Confederation|Xiyeru state]]-appointed governor of the [[Rhavo todo|foreign villages]] in [[T'ugü]], [[Koxĭya Eōʼene]], completed the great restructuring of society known as [[Tuvöblin]], resulting in the peaceful independence of the [[Lavondu|Lavondu nation]]. Were it not for Kōlăcetĭ's executive intervention, [[Koxĭya Eōʼene|Koxĭya]] may have been received by the [[Azodo]] authority as acting outside her jurisdiction and potentially prosecuted. Instead, history celebrates her as the founder of a diverse and flourishing nation.
## Gubernatorial term limits
Kōlăcetĭ was one of the earliest proponents of a term limit for [[Āʼiyoru|governors]], himself abdicating after serving four terms despite his likely imminent re-election. In 930, fifty years after his death, an amendment known as *Sēnĭ Kōlăcetĭkī* "[[Kōlăcetĭ]]'s law" was made to the unwritten constitution of the [[Xiyeru Confederation]], calling for general [[Āʼiyoru|gubernatorial]] elections every 1540 terms, meaning a [[Āʼiyoru|governor]] could serve a maximum of four terms before they could be removed from office by the [[Nīholu]] noble class who were eligible to vote, though this did not prevent indefinite re-election as Kōlăcetĭ had dreamed of.

Before his election to the position of [[Āʼiyoru|governor]], Kōlăcetĭ was well known throughout the island of [[Azodo]] as benevolent, fair, and neighbourly above all else, and would often personally contribute significantly to the labour of his projects.

The new governor is shown here standing proud before an audience of ministers and interested nobles who have gathered for his inauguration at the outdoor "chamber" of the general assembly in the city of **[[Wītēxĭlohato]]** (Xiri *Mamadēzirovā*). A whole foot taller than the average [[Xiyeru]] man, he towers above any crowd at 6'4" (193cm), or more like 6'8" (203cm) with those shoes on. His outfit, like all [[Xiyeru]] clothing, very deliberately exposes the arms and legs so that [[Ńaʼay|tattoos]] are always visible. In his case especially so, as his skirt, a slightly fancier variation of the usual male wear, is extra short to show off his prestigious thigh [[Ńaʼay|tattoos]]. His [[Ńaʼay|tattoos]] are of the classic [[Azodo]] elite style which remained influential throughout the [[Lavondu]] world for many centuries, and which informed the creation of the [[Ahōtoli script]]. His extravagant head and neck arrangement is ceremonial gear reserved only for high status individuals like governors and important ministers. Men also tend not to cover their chest and stomach, though it is rare to [[Ńaʼay|tattoo]] below the upper chest, except for the [[weʼańaʼay|"river-markings"]] given to mothers and occasionally fathers.

On the right (his left) stands **[[Yakĭwowo]]**, his spouse and contemporary minister of coastal fisheries for [[Azodo]], soon to be elevated to the minister of astronomy, a much more prestigious position. Yakĭwowo was assigned male at birth, but their unique [[Ńaʼay|tattoo]] style and big poofy leafy shorts that [[Xiyeru]] women of the period like to wear express their being a part of a third gender called **[[Xiyeru gender#Third gender|myogiru]]** or **yādagiru** in [[Xiri]], **nekĭlu** in [[Ahōtoli]] and **mísul** in [[Möxali]]. It encompasses a broad range of non-binary gender identities which often align more with feminine than masculine expression, and is socially associated with a stronger spiritual connection of the [[Xiyeru parts of the self|body, blood and spirit]] to their corresponding worldly materials.

On the left, a young judge who has been afforded the opportunity to host the inauguration ceremony and essentially represent that all proceedings take place according to the law code. Her plain, dark cloak signifies her holding of a judicial office and is her usual working wear, while the big fancy hat is only for special occasions. Her [[Ńaʼay|tattoos]] are again a bit different since she is from the far north island [[Kigipwa]], which like the other four islands has a characteristic traditional style.
