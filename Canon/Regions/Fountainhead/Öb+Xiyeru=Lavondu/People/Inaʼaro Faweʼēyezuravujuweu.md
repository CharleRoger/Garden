**Inaʼaro Faweʼēyezuravujuweu** "two-sharks who computes the unending count" was a [[Xiyeru]] natural philosopher born in the late [[6th century]], whose work has since been copied, translated and redistributed for over a millennium. He was among the first mathematicians to develop rigorous methods of writing proofs, almost leading to a mathematical revolution among the scholars of [[Udovuʼo]] before all was cut short by the [[Exodus period#The Great Sickness (655 AGS)|Great Sickness of 655]]. His ideas were revived and sustained under the newly established [[Azodo Government]] of the [[9th century]] and brought back to the forefront of philosophical thought during the [[Lavondu Golden Age]] beginning in the [[12th century]], leaving a lasting impact on the field of mathematics.

**[[Suravuju Tarudaru Ō Cazurakyo]]** "would that the unending sequence come to end" was a particularly prolific treatise composed by Inaʼaro. It gives a comprehensive overview of the properties of arithmetic, quadratic and geometric sequences and sums. The text is almost entirely composed of extremely long-winded thought experiments intended to illustrate numerical patterns of interest to the author, but does also include some genuinely ground-breaking mathematics, such as proofs of many ideas which had previously been assumed true, and perhaps the first use of what could be called algebra.

The purpose of much of Inaʼaro's writing was to demonstrate the effectiveness of rigorous algorithms in producing accurate mathematical results, however tedious. To give an example of this flavour of mathematical rigor, here is one such demonstration from *[[Suravuju Tarudaru Ō Cazurakyo]]*, which simultaneously proves 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16... = 1 and 1/2 - 1/4 + 1/8 - 1/16... = 1/3. It begins:
> *Rhavoru ō faʼēha tiwēwažeʼe tuzuyo ē caruf fužeʼe*
> `other OPT do-PFV ground-LOC mark-ACC then stand there-LOC`
> "Would that you were to make a mark on the ground and stand at it"

The complete argument then proceeds like so:
> Would that you were to turn westward and step with 8 (steps), then turn eastward and step with 4, then the first walk were to end.
> You would then, after stepping 12 total, see the mark 4 or one third of the total in front of you.
> 
> Would that you were to turn westward and step with 2, then turn eastward and step with 1, then the second walk were to end with one quarter of the (length of the) first (walk).
> You would then, after stepping 15 total, see the mark 5 or one third of the total in front of you.
> 
> Would that you not cease, but continue walking.
> 
> Would that you were to turn westward and step with 1/2, then turn eastward and step with 1/4, then the third walk were to end with one quarter of the second (walk).
> You would then, after stepping 15 and 3/4 total, see the mark 5 and 1/4 or one third of the total in front of you.
> 
> Would that you were to turn westward and step with 1/8, then turn eastward and step with 1/16, then the fourth walk were to end with one quarter of the third (walk).
> You would then, after stepping 15 and 15/16 total, see the mark 5 and 5/16 or one third of the total in front of you.
> 
> Would that you not cease, but continue walking without end.
> 
> Would that you were to turn westward and step some distance, then turn eastward and step half that distance, then the current walk were to end with one quarter of the previous (walk).
> You would then, after stepping some total, see the mark one third of the total in front of you.
> 
> Would that the final walk come to end.
> The total walk would be equal to the remainder excepting the first (walk), doubled and doubled again, then the first walk would be three quarters of the total.
> You would then, after stepping 16 total, see the mark 5 and 1/3 or one third of the total in front of you.

This is, very verbosely, just saying:
> x = 8 + 4 + 2 + 1... = 8 + 4 + ¼(8 + 4 + 2 + 1...) = 12 + ¼x
> ¾x = 12 → x = 16
> 
> y = 8 - 4 + 2 - 1... = 8 - 4 + ¼(8 - 4 + 2 - 1...) = 4 + ¼y
> ¾y = 4 → y = 16/3
