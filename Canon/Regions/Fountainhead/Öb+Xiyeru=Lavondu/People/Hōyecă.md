**Hōyecă** (887 – 959) was an [[Azodo]]-born [[Xiyeru]] ship-builder and explorer, credited with the [[Exploration of Cqa#Voyages by Hōyecă|938 rediscovery of Cqa]] and the first acquisition of [[plink]] by a non-[[Maicqa]] person.

Hōyecă is depicted here in attire which is not typical of a resident of [[Udovuʼo]] in his period, where extensive cloth was typically only worn by people of a high spiritual rank. It was not taboo for a common person to wear cloth in this manner, it was simply unfashionable, men preferred to dress very minimally with typically just a grass or leaf skirt. His being a ship-builder in [[T'ugü]] afforded him access to a great deal of [[lilaw]] cloth, nominally for sails, but which he made use of to dress in the [[T'ugü]] style, as the [[Öb]] had done for centuries.

He carries sixteen 1x2x4 blocks of [[plink]], destined to be shipped off to [[Udovuʼo]] to enlighten some intellectual or amuse some minister's children. This ~0.4m³ of material weighs only 4-6kg and would float to the ground like a feather if dropped, but is actually from the [[Plink#Physical properties|densest layer of plink]] found close to the surface of the floating islands.
