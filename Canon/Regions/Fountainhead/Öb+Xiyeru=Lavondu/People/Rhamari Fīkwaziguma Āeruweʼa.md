**Rhamari Fīkwaziguma Āeruweʼa** (c. 580 - 708 [[Universal calendar|AGS]]) was the [[Āeruweʼa#Numbering|81st Āeruweʼa]] from 622 until her death in 708, and the last [[Āeruweʼa]] to wield a significant degree of political power of [[Udovuʼo]].

# Name and titles
The [[Āeruweʼa|Āeruweʼa's]] *[[Ńuʼu|Xińuʼu]]* "true-name" *Rhamari* is equivalent to the compound *rham-ari* "sticky-coil". It is not known why this name was chosen or whether this was the intended meaning, though it was transliterated as such into other languages, such as the [[Möxali]] *Semari*, from *sima* "sticky". In later historical documentation, this name is rendered in the [[Ahōtoli script]] using the characters *lewŭ* "sticky" and *elĭ* "coil", cognates to the original [[Xiri]] components.

Her posthumous *[[Ńuʼu|Mū’ojūńuʼu]]* "forever-name" *Fīkwaziguma* literally means "who has an obsidian heart". This was a title granted to certain [[Āeruweʼa]] who lived in times of severe hardship and were forced to make difficult, often unpopular decisions.
# Early life
Rhamari was born in a village near the [[Kaʼāʼi river]], c. 580 [[Universal calendar|AGS]]. Her mother was a yam farmer, and it was said that the village was a significant provider of yams to the nearby city of [[Fenimeni]], where Rhamari studied as a scribe during her adolescence.

In 599, she was selected as one of twelve [[Āeruweʼa]] candidates by her predecessor [[Inagewižā Fazegigōrakwi Āeruweʼa]], who had ascended the role of [[Āeruweʼa]] two years prior.
# Life as Āeruweʼa
After the untimely death of [[Inagewižā Fazegigōrakwi Āeruweʼa]] in 622, Rhamari immediately assumed the role of Āeruweʼa. One of her first acts was to re-standardise the [[Ugugo]] writing system to bring it in line with modern changes in pronunciation and new uses that the writing had acquired in [[T'ugü]].

Rhamari's first few decades as [[Āeruweʼa]] were prosperous for the [[Xiyeru]], who benefited greatly from trade with the [[Öb]]. The [[Rhavo todo]] "foreign villages", [[Xiyeru]] settlements in [[T'ugü]], hosted many [[Xiyeru]] traders and explorers, from whence they sailed up and down the coast of [[Fountainhead]], continuously expanding the [[Xiyeru|Xiyeru's]] influence and knowledge of the world.

Rhamari was notably interested in the outside world, having spent some time in [[T'ugü]] and [[Irimri]] and reportedly learning the [[Low Alöbi|Alöbi]] language to a reasonable degree. She is known for the [[Exploration of Cqa#Early historical accounts|Xiyeru discovery of Cqa]], a task which she had personally decreed, and the commissioning of many historical almanacs, translations of foreign texts, and compendiums of knowledge of the world. Perhaps her most enduring legacy is her famous [[String maps#Fīkwaziguma's Map|string map of the world]].

In 655, a mysterious disease broke out in [[Udovuʼo]], which the [[Xiyeru]] called *[[Exodus period#The Great Sickness (655 AGS)|Āzamatwa]]* "great sickness", which led to a famine *[[Exodus period#The Great Hunger (656 - 664 AGS)|Āguwo]]* "great hunger", and eventually to a mass emigration to [[T'ugü]] known as *[[Exodus period#The Great Departure (c. 660 - 700/701 AGS)|Āega]]* "great departure". This began the [[Exodus period]], which in its first few decades saw [[Udovuʼo]] lose around 90% of its population. The exodus took place against the [[Āeruweʼa|Āeruweʼa's]] official recommendation to remain in [[Udovuʼo]] until the famine had been resolved. Rhamari also controversially refused aid from [[T'ugü]], believing the [[Öb]], perhaps rightly, to be the source of the great sickness. It was in recognition of her response to these events that Rhamari was posthumously granted *Fīkwaziguma*. If she had not so defiantly severed connection with [[T'ugü]], the [[Xiyeru]] may have suffered a complete loss of population, or at least an irreparable destruction of the [[Xiyeru]] tradition and way of life.

In her later years, Rhamari endured the transfer of de facto political power from the [[Eruweʼa]] priesthood and the [[Āeruweʼa]] herself to the *[[Āʼiyoru]]* "governor" of each island, who had until then been a mostly ceremonial role. This culminated at the beginning of the [[8th century]] in the formation of the [[Azodo Government]] and [[Xiyeru Confederation]], the first unified [[Xiyeru]] state in [[Udovuʼo]].
