**Koxĭya Ahoukēholuʼŭihă** was an accomplished [[Xiyeru]] accountant and politician from [[Erido]] who served as the first and only [[Āʼiyoru|governor]] of [[Lavto,]] known as the mastermind behind the [[Tuvöblin]] project which established the [[Zúnton]] system in [[T'ugü]] in 861 AGS.
# Name and titles
Koxĭya's official title as governor of [[Lavto]] was *ʼuhi Aʼĭolu Lăhototokīʼă* (first governor in the [[Rhavo todo|foreign villages]]), though she was more often known to the [[Xiyeru]] populace as *Yaʼŭhi Aʼĭolu* (the sixth [[Āʼiyoru|governor]]) or just Yaʼŭhi.
# Life and work
## In Udovuʼo
Koxĭya was born around 800 [[Universal calendar|AGS]] to a noble family on [[Erido]], the main central island of [[Udovuʼo]], during the administration of the [[Azodo Government]]. She likely spoke a local dialect in her youth, but later spoke only [[Ahōtoli]], the dominant language of the period. Like most other people of noble descent in this period, she learnt to read and write the [[Ahōtoli script]], as well as mathematics, economics and politics in a state-managed university on her home island.

At some point in her youth she moved to [[Azodo]], where she worked as an accountant and political negotiator for several noble families. She quickly achieved fame and rose up the political ranks, eventually being appointed minister of inter-island trade for [[Azodo]] in 838 AGS.
## In T'ugü
Koxĭya was elected to be the first governor of [[Lavto]] by the [[Azodo Government]] in 844 AGS due to her experience managing trade routes in [[Udovuʼo]], hence also bearing the name Eʼōene (rice-bringer). She was to be a diplomatic figurehead in the foreign land, with the express purpose of ensuring the security of the culture and people descended from the [[Xiyeru]]. In fact, the motivation for a sixth governor was likely to restore trade routes of old and reconnect [[T'ugü]] to the [[Udovuʼo]] economy, as this was [[Koxĭya Ahoukēholuʼŭihă|Koxĭya's]] primary field of work in [[Udovuʼo]].

Large-scale trade with [[T'ugü]] was eventually re-established, but Koxĭya did not succeed in this goal alone. This was the culmination of an arduous process involving thousands of people from all backgrounds in [[T'ugü]], in which Koxĭya was instrumental. She recognised that the population of [[T'ugü]] was distributed quite differently to [[Udovuʼo]], and without concentrated centres of population, the traditional [[Xiyeru]] political systems would be of little use to organising the production and movement of resources on a large scale.

Koxĭya is said to have spent her first two years in [[T'ugü]] travelling to every corner of the land, living with families of [[Lavondu]] and [[Öb]] and learning their languages and social culture. From her travels, she determined that populations were not centralised enough for any kind of [[Udovuʼo]]-style state managed by powerful politicians, but that the continuous relationships between neighbouring settlements were invaluable if large-scale communication and organisation were to be attained.

In 846 [[Universal calendar|AGS]], after her initial period of research, Koxĭya began devising the [[Zúnton]] system of communication and collective resource management and distribution. She ultimately played a fairly minor role in the actual trade route management side of things, for which she was originally chosen, but is quite rightly credited in the contemporary written histories of the time with solely initiating [[Tuvöblin]] by developing [[Zúnton]].
