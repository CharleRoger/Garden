**Rhamari Fīkwazikuma Āeruweʼa** (600 - [[Universal calendar|AGS]]) was the [[Āeruweʼa]]
# Name and titles
The [[Āeruweʼa|Āeruweʼa's]] [[Ńuʼu|Xińuʼu]] "true-name" *Rhamari* is equivalent to the compound *rham-ari* "sticky-coil". It is not known why this name was chosen or whether it was meaning was originally intended, though it was transliterated as such into other languages, such as the [[Möxali]] *Semari*, from *sima* "sticky". In later historical documentation, this name is rendered in the [[Ahōtoli script]] using the characters *lewŭ* "sticky" and *elĭ* "coil", cognates to the original [[Xiri]] components.

Her posthumous [[Ńuʼu|Mū’ojūńuʼu]] "forever-name" *Fīkwazikuma* literally means "who has an obsidian heart". This was a title granted to certain [[Āeruweʼa]] who lived in times of severe hardship and were forced to make difficult, often unpopular decisions.
