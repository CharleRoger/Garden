**Cetănehă** (c. 630 – 726) was the [[Āʼiyoru|governor]] of [[Azodo]] from 694 to 726, and is said to have directed the formation of the [[Azodo Government]] c. 700 AGS.
# Name
*Cetănehă* is a simple compound, *cetă* "narrow part" + *nehă* "ribcage".
# Descendants
The longest traceable male-line in Xiyeru history is that beginning with Cetănehă, or technically his grandfather, by virtue of contributing to his father's name, before which there is no written record of their heritage.

Descendants of Cetănehă became one of the largest and most influential of the noble [[Nīholu]] families which emerged in the [[9th century]], bearing the ancestral name *Cetănehăkī*. In the [[11th century]], four of the five [[Āʼiyoru|gubernatorial]] offices were won by Cetănehăkī cousins, beginning the [[Xiyeru Confederation#Cetănehă dynasty (1042 - 1192)|Cetănehă dynasty]]. 

Notable members of house Cetănehă:
- [[Yawăyawă]] (great-great-grandson), [[Azodo]] [[Āʼiyoru|governor]] from 845 to 856.
