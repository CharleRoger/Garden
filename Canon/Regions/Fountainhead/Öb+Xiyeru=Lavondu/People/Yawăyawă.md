**Yawăyawă** (777 – 879) was the [[Āʼiyoru|governor]] of [[Azodo]] from 845 to 856, and the last to inherit the role automatically without electoral challenge. He was the great-great-grandson of [[Cetănehă]], one of the founding [[Āʼiyoru|governors]] of the [[Azodo Government]].
# Name
*Yawăyawă* simply means "mass of folded fabric".
# Politics
Yawăyawă was begrudgingly instrumental in the passing of a law in 855 which allowed the newly-formed [[Nīholu]] sociopolitical caste to organise, amongst themselves, an election to replace their island's [[Āʼiyoru|governor]] with a new representative. He was removed from office the following year by that very law, replaced by the far more popular [[Kōlăcetĭ]]. The electoral system was [[Xiyeru Confederation#Electoral reform|reformed]] again in 990 to encourage a more regular election cycle and longer terms in office.
