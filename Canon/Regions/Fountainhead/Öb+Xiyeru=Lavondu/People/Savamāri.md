**Savamāri** was a semi-legendary [[ńa’ayeru]] (tattooist) in [[Xiyeru]] history who is said to have invented writing in 729 BGS.
# Traditional legend
[[Fobizāgāju Āeruweʼa]] heard word of a [[ńaʼayeru]] on the far north island of [[Kigipwa]] who was said to be able to write out a *xi’iyo* (ritual aphorism) in such a way that a student of theirs who had never heard that particular xi’iyo was able to read it and speak it out loud. The [[Āeruweʼa]] saw the power of such an ability, and travelled to meet with Savamāri for a demonstration in person. This is unusual for an [[Āeruweʼa]], who normally stays at her home on the main island while people travel from all around [[Udovuʼo]] seeking her advice.

Upon their first meeting, it was revealed to the [[Āeruweʼa]] that Savamāri could not speak, hence their posthumously-granted name *Savamāri* "who needs no tongue", which might be taken literally to mean they actually had no tongue. They began to scratch symbols, some familiar and some unfamiliar, into the parallel lines on a large *anaw* (~banana leaf). They then had one of their students recite the text, a greeting and praise of the [[Āeruweʼa]]. Her excitement was justified and her expectations exceeded, she proclaimed the invention the most invaluable since the development of the sailing canoe. Her own faith in the system was evident, though her personal [[ńa’ayeru]] were skeptical, perhaps affronted by the prospect of this tongueless person doing their job better than them. They reluctantly verified that the system was able to do what was claimed and Savamāri was brought back to the [[Erido|main island]] the next morning.

Savamāri was appointed the new role of *Ańa’ayeru* (grand tattooist) and immediately began work overseeing the development of a new version of the *[[Ugugo]]* "very many cuts", and teaching it to as many people as possible until their death in 641 BGS.
# Historicity
Savamāri was almost certainly a real person, as the historical record surrounding their later life and funeral in particular appear to be accurate and legitimate. It is unlikely that a single person invented writing ex nihilo, rather it appears that [[Xiyeru]] writing developed as a notation system for personal names on census records and similar documents.

The earliest surviving writing in [[Udovuʼo]] dates from around 500 BGS, but it is reasonable that writing could have been utilised as early as 729 BGS. Savamāri most likely represents a broader movement occurring in the 8th century BGS, in which the name-writing techniques of the [[ńa’ayeru]] started to see use beyond the tattoo itself and in physical records of information.
