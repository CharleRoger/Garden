A suf is an [[Ardanic people|Ardanic]] state official tasks with matters of state, bureaucracy, infrastructure, medicine and other things. In the [[Tyon-Arat]] since around the [[5th century]] the training and organization of the different kinds of Suf have been streamlined and centralised. All Suf are examined and ordained by a central institution in the city of the [[Tyeleš]], which is intrinsically linked to the [[Theyteče Arapa|House of Knowledge]]. The only large exception are the agricultural officials, which are trained in the city of [[Alpa]]. 

Another large matter of centralisation is that all Suf are in service to the state and are paid by the state. While experienced scholars have some freedom and receive a small payment just for having passed the training, most are simply state employees. Though at the same time Suf are greatly respected by society and are known to also work for private contracts, although they have to abandon these if they are called for. They are thus subserviant to the [[Ardanian government]] system. 

The Houses of Knowledge in Tyeleš and Alpa make the centralised examination of the Suf, but they also require some previous education, which at least entails basic literacy and numeracy. People can receive that education either from the Houses of Knowledge, private schools set up by other scholars or by schools run by an [[Itif]], which directly aim at educating their members. 

There are many fields of knowledge a Suf can be trained in. The role of Suf came into being after the foundation of the Tyon-Arat, but similar professionals existed already before the unification of the three cities. It is generally believed that further going back in time, the Suf were originally ritualistic professionals, who played a large role in the old [[Ardanic religion]]. Even today the Suf are partially still linked to religion. Those who pass they exams are expected to make sacrifices and pay devotions. The House of Knowledge has shrines within its institutions, where new Suf pay respect to the forerunners of their discipline. Respected members of a certain discipline are also reverred in the fashion of ancestor cults. 

After the [[Šrašipmi]], the House of Knowledge in [[Asterin-Nem]] acted in rebellion and started to issue examinations and ordinations of Suf on their own. This process was not legitimized by the Tyon-Arat, but lead to an increased independence of the Ardanians in the [[Uhustaw]]. 
## Suf of the first degree (Tpasmen Suf)
Suf is also the name for a non-specialised state bureaucrat, who has received their basic training and passed their exams. The basic education of any Suf includes four fields of knowledge 1) letters and literature, 2) mathematics and geometry 3) agriculture 4) laws and rites. To pass the examination one requires literacy and numeracy. Exams are organized in certain intervals and students can show up without further notice (if they are citizens), irrespective of whether they have received their education at the House of Knowledge or elsewhere. Most Suf without specialisation become very basic state servants, mostly working under more specialised Suf in larger projects. 

## Kemtu
Main article: [[Kemtu]]
The Kemtu is a scribe and was used for accounting early on, however the title of the Kemtu became sort of devalued later on and the scribal profession became less specialised. The Yastak later took the place of the Kemtu in the accounting position. Thereafter Kemtu became largely obsolete as rank of Suf and instead became a mere title of those mostly occupied with scribal work.
## Theytu 
Main article: [[Theytu]]
The Theytu is another less well defined position. Originally Theytu meant as much as "scholar" or "philosopher". The term was applied to those working in the House of Knowledge itself as teachers or "faculty staff". They are higher ranking Suf officials, who chose to not become [[Kele]]. Some Stera (retired) are also regarded as Theytu, as they proceed to do research for the sake of research itself. After the [[7th century]] reforms, teachers and researchers at a House of Knowledge are generally considered to be Theytu. Thus it became closer to just a title, rather than a separate rank. 
## Krut
Main article: [[Krut]]
A Krut is a minister of war, defense and all things regarding the military. All Krut also receive a primary physical education as soldiers. Furthermore they are trained in the usage of weapons, as well as how they are made, including siege weapons, forts and garrisons and so on. Their main focus however on being concerned with strategies, tactics and logistics, as well as drafting people, keeping note of who is eligible as a soldiers and so on. 
## Phaš
Main article: [[Phaš]]
The most numerous group of state officials are the Phaš. They also have one of the most important jobs, being responsible for the irrigation systems around the Tyon-Arat, as well as the gigantic [[Ardanic irrigation system|Praš basins]]. They have regularly check on them, spot weak points and order repair work, as well as build new constructions and maintain old ones. Most Kele are Phaš who are directed to work on public infrastructure. The Phaš also have the highest responsibility of all, as them failing their job could potentially endanger thousands of people.
## Kusut 
Main article: [[Kusut]]
The term _kusut_ is a loan from Kathurn, the name of the Kost priests who ran the temple economy of the early Lowland cities. As such, in the 1st till 5th centuries, Kusut was the name of a high ranking Suf official who was active in planing and allocating resources for public infrastructure and agriculture. The job of the Kusut was more and more taken over by the Phaš and eventually the Kusut became but a subtype of Phaš, rendering it obsolete as a rank, but keeping it as a title. 

## Erti

The job of the so called "border official", the Erti is a rather versatile one. Originally they were concerned with bureaucracy and in particular measurements. Measuring land area in particular, assigning borders to plots of land and assisting in matters of conflicts between landholders.

Due to this they were also engaged in diplomacy and many Erti learned foreign languages.

## Htayaš

## Yastak
Main article: [[Yastak]]
Originally the Yastak were a rather small group, mainly concerned with mathematics as well as astrology/astronomy.
