**Qneček** were tribal confederations making up the political structure of [[Hnäzb people#Society|Hnäzb society]]. During [[Hnäzb people|Hnäzb]] history, there have been several great Qneček. Notable among them are the Qneček of [[Eight-Antler]], [[Red-Deer]] and [[Celestial-Dancer]].

# Etymology

The term *Qneček* is from one of the [[Hnäzb languages]] and means as much as "united herd".

# Structure

Each Qneček had a leading group, which consisted of a clan of [[Ugo-lord|ugo-lords]] and their immediate vassals. The system of vassalage was based on oaths and distribution of resources. The system was not entirely institutionalised and alliances were often brittle. They mainly relied on constant diplomacy and engagement. Raiding was an important part of [[Hnäzb people|Hnäzb culture]] and members of a Qneček expected their loyalty to be repaid in [[ugo]], precious metals, tools and also slaves. Acquiring actual land was not particularly emphasized in [[Hnäzb people|Hnäzbic]] wars, mainly because their economy was pastoral. This low emphasis on land control differentiates the Qneček-system from the [[Sat'öḫ stewardship]] system, which prevailed among the [[Hnäzb people]] of the [[Uhustaw]].
