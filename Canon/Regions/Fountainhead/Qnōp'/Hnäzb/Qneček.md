The term Qneček is from one of the  [[Hnäzb languages]] and means as much as "united herd". They are tribal confederations, which make up the political structure of [[Hnäzb society|Hnäzb people]]. Each Qneček has a leading group, which consists of a clan of [[Ugo-Lords]] and their immediate vassals. The system of vassalage is based on oaths and distribution of resources. The system is not entirely institutionalised and alliances are often brittle. They mainly rely on constant diplomacy and engagement. Raiding is an important part of Hnäzb culture and members of a Qneček expect their loyalty to be repaid in Ugo, precious metals, tools and also slaves. Acquiring actual land is not very emphasized in Hnäzbic wars, mainly because their economy is pastoral.
This low emphasis on land control differentiates the Qneček-system from the [[Sat'öḫ stewardship]] system, which prevails among the Hnäzb people of the [[Uhustaw]].

During Hnäzb history, there have been several great Qneček. Notable among them are the Qneček of [[Eight-Antler]], [[Red-Deer]] and [[Celestial-Dancer]].
