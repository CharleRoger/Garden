The religion of the [[Hn채zb people]] shares several commonalities with the religions of other [[Koyanic languages|Koyanic]] peoples, but has developed in its own unique way due to the lifestyle of the Hn채zb people. 

## Cosmology 

The worldview of the Hn채zb divides the world into five parts, all of which are equally real and trascendent. They are intrinsically linked together and both accessible and inaccessible to humans and/or human spirits. 

The uppermost and most glorious of all realms is the realm of the sun, the moons and the stars, the pure realm of light. The second sphere is the celestial sphere of the sky, where above the clouds celestial Ugos are kept and herded. Below it is the world of humans, animals and plants. Then there is the watery sphere of the ocean and lastly the chthonic subterranean sphere. 

Furthermore the Hn채zb also categorise cardinal directions along these lines. There are five cardinal directions. The cardinal directions orientate themselves according to the five spheres, rather than north-south-east-west. Essentially they are ocean-side, earth-side, central, up and down. The ocean is always in the west and in the east a desert stretches on forever. Up and down are according to the typology, while the central areas are given by the zenith of the sun. North and south-proper are given as right side and left side of the sun. In this view one assumes the "viewpoint" of the sun running east to west, while the front is to the west and east is in the back.  

There are also five elements. Light, air, life, water and earth. Fire is not seen as an element, but an emanation or aspect of light, as it is emited by the sun, the same way that rock and metal are to earth. Furthermore the distinction between celestial fire (the sun and lightning) and chthonic fire (volcanoes) is made. 
The element of life is either believed to be a single life-giving essence or a substance, which is made out of all and corresponds to the idea of a center. The living being combines earth (bones and wood) water (blood and sap), air (breath) and light (sight, colour) in one.
