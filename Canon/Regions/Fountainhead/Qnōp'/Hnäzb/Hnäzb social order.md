#hnäzb

This article describes the social order of the "Common [[Hnäzb people]]" during the classical era of Hnäzb history, which lasted from the [[4th century|4th]] to the [[7th century]] AGS. During this time the Hnäzb were a very affluent people, who controlled the vast [[Red Steppe]]. Many tribal confederations called [[Qneček]] rose and fell during this time. One of the earliest of these great polities was the federation of [[Red-Deer]]. The last powerful polity was that of [[Celestial-Dancer]], whose death in 645 AGS triggered the political dissolution of most Hnäzb polities.

# Social strata

Five social strata were traditionally recognised, though in reality there were more social groups which varied throughout history.

1. [[Ugo-lords]]: A highly mobile, elite warrior class representing the leadership of the clans.
2. [[Star-eyes]]: A priest class who composed epic poetry legitimising the reverence of past heroes and great leaders.
3. Steppe-dwellers: The largest caste, consisting of semi-nomadic pastoralists making annual migrations.
4. [[Knaqh]]-dwellers: Settled farmers living in farmsteads and villages under the control of the [[Ugo-lords]].
5. Outsiders or subdued foreigners.

## Ugo-lords

*Main article: [[Ugo-lord]]*

The highest social stratum of [[Hnäzb people#Society|Hnäzb society]] was the most prominent. They were called [[Ugo-lords]]. This warrior elite was highly mobile and engaged in most high prestige activities. They made up the leadership of the clans and cared for intertribal relations.

While they highly idolized war, they were not just warriors, but also traders and diplomats. In fact, the typical warrior image made up only a fraction of their actual lifestyle. Many actually never went to war. They needed to be mobile to constantly hold up and curate relations with their allies and establish new connections. Additionally, they engaged in ritual activities and regularly held festivals.

Their exploits were immortalised in [[Hnäzb people|Hnäzb]] epic poems and legends and there was an ideological component of gaining prestige and aiming to stand among those mythical ancestral figures.

While social strata were envisioned as closed groups, there was still a mobility among them. Due to the ideological component, people were encouraged to seek warrior's glory to become part of that elite. As such, the actual number and power of the great clans could vary from time to time and new clans could rise, while old clans went into decline.

## Star-eyes

*Main article: [[Star-eyes]]*

The next traditional class of [[Hnäzb people|Hnäzb]] society were the priests called [[Star-eyes]]. Among them were also the [[Star-eyes#Sun-moon-singers|Sun-moon-singers]], a specific group of priests who acted as poets composing epics to embellish the exploits of past heroes and great leaders. These priests acted as storytellers and kept track of the histories of the [[Hnäzb people]], though such stories often contained both real and mythical elements and were highly stylised. Other priests carried out important ritual events or engaged in divining.

While some priests did inherit their position, for others it was an office which could be gained, while yet others felt chosen by the gods and became priests through that calling. Thus, belonging to the priest class was, like the other classes, a fluid matter in actuality.

## Steppe dwellers

In the traditional view, Steppe-dwellers, who made up the bulk of [[Hnäzb people|Hnäzb]] population, were considered to form a stratum above settled people. They were semi-nomadic people who lived off pastoralism and annually migrated between pastures. There was usually a certain area in which migration took place and, during the winter, people often returned to specific locations to make camp.

## Knaqh dwellers

The next group were the [[Knaqh]]-dwellers, settled farmers living in farmsteads and villages under Hnäzb control. They didn't herd any [[ugo]], which excluded them from the semi-nomadic lifestyle viewed as central to [[Hnäzb people|Hnäzb culture]]. Yet they also played a vital part in [[Hnäzb people|Hnäzb]] economy as they cultivated various crops and most importantly provided textiles and metals. [[Hnäzb people|Hnäzb culture]], as opposed to its predecessors, knew metal work and, despite hardly mining anything themselves and acquiring ores mostly through trading and raiding, had highly skilled blacksmiths.

The actual boundary between the settled population and the semi-nomadic one was also very fluid and there was a larger divide between different professions than between villagers and pastoralists. Most villagers kept at least a few [[ugo]], as well as cattle, and most pastoralists cultivated small gardens alongside their homes. The only people who truly owned no [[ugo]] were craftspeople like smiths, carpenters and weavers. On the linguistic side, the specific vocabulary of these professions, besides the smith of course, was littered with substrate words.
