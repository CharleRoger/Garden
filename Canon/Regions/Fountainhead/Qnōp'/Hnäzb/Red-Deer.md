**Red-Deer** or **Taałndzı-Řaba** was a powerful [[Hnäzb people|Hnäzb]] warlord of the [[4th century]] AGS. Red-Deer is credited with founding the first great [[Qneček]] and conquering seven cities of [[Nambō]] and surrounding areas. Red-Deer became the quintessential [[Hnäzb people|Hnäzb]] warlord, whom others tried to emulate for centuries.

## Early Life

Most of the early life of Red-Deer is shrouded in mystery. It is not known when he was born, but there are legends, which tell that his mother was foretold the arrival of a great conqueror. Some say his father was an [[ugo]]-demigod or a mountain spirit or that his mother was a daughter of the sky.

Red-Deer gathered followers early in life and became a charismatic leader. The year 320 AGS is traditionally held as important, as in this year he would take leadership of five tribe and form a [[Qneček]]. The organization of a [[Qneček]] may or may not have existed before in [[Hnäzb people#Society|Hnäzb society]], but Red-Deer utilised its whole potential. Within a few years he began to build a great realm.

## The Great Warlord

Over the next decades Red-Deer would attack the cities of the [[Nambō]] coastland. It is said that in 331 he won his greatest victory. In a single campaign he subjugated seven cities and made them pay tribute, made them slaves and took their [[ugo]] and all their other livestock or so it is told on the many memory stones that Red-Deer erected.

The [[Hnäzb people|Hnäzb]] were not a literate people, but during his campaigns Red-Deer saw that the [[Nambō|Nambs]] erected stelae to commemorate their leaders. He did not understand the words written on them, but he copied some of them to mark his own victories. The exploits of Red-Deer remained a common and popular topic within [[Hnäzb people|Hnäzb]] art.

## Death and legacy

In 362 AGS Red-Deer would succumb to an illness and he chose his second-born son [[Silver-Eye]] to be his successor. From them on it would be [[Hnäzb people|Hnäzb]] custom that a leader would chose their successor. There was no fixed line of inheritance and thus realms remained very unstable. If a leader would die, it was brother against brother and kin against kin, making the many [[Hnäzb people#Society|Hnäzb polities]] generally short lived.

Yet Red-Deer would remain in [[Hnäzb people|Hnäzb]] memory as one-of-a-kind. His realm and his reign alone would found many traditions for the coming centuries.
