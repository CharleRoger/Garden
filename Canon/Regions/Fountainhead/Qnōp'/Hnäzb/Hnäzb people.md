#people #hnäzb #red_steppe

The **Hnäzb** were a semi-nomadic people who inhabited the [[Red Steppe]] and neighboring regions, such as the [[Uhustaw]], which they called *[[Uhustaw#Name|Čüüwän]]* in the [[Common Hnäzb]] language.

# Name and Identity

The term *[[Common Hnäzb dictionary#hnäzb|Hnäzb]]* is foremost linguistic in nature and identifies people who speak the [[Hnäzb languages]]. Though the same people also share a common lifestyle and culture, they are internally diverse and the way they regard each other is differentiated by tribal and social affiliations. The term itself might as well have only meant the nomadic upper class of these people, who were during their history also the most prolific and infamous in other lands.

# History

## Proto-Hnäzb period 

The so called Proto-Hnäzb is both a linguistic and historical time period, which roughly covers the time from around [[1st millennium BGS|1000 BGS]] till around 0 AGS and makes up the genesis of Hnäzbic culture and language. The Proto-Hnäzb period consists of the linguistic and cultural transition from a broader [[Q'ač culture]].

Proto-Hnäzb probably originates from a region in northern [[Kóty]] or southern [[Krobu]], an area later known as [[Bezgon]], slightly northwest to the area of early [[Qachkav people]], their closest linguistic relatives. The environment of this area consists of temperate oceanic lowlands and forests, as well as small hills. This makes it overall pretty different from the [[Red Steppe]], where most of later Hnäzb culture was situated. This also meant that the lifestyle of early Proto-Hnäzb was likely rather different from their later descendants. In archaeological terms, the culture inhabiting northernmost [[Koty]] during this time is called the [[Northern-Koty Pre-Metallic Complex]] (NKPMC).  
Proto-Hnäzb culture was probably still very close to early [[Q'achkav culture]]. At the same time there is a slight difference between the inhabitants of the coast and the hinterlands. Due to the lack of written records and general cultural similarity it is not clear which of these groups spoke an early [[Gäj languages|Gäj language]] and which ones spoke [[Proto-Hnäzb language|Proto-Hnäzb]].

The Proto-Hnäzb were for the most part not nomadic, but had a pastoral lifestyle and lived in small village communities. They primarily herded cattle. Despite their lush homeland there is no indication that they practised large scale agriculture, nor that they build large settlements or even cities. Apart from pastoralism they also practised horticulture and were occasional foragers. There is some indication for conflict with the neighbouring mountain tribes, as well as early [[Koto-Dreic languages|Dreic]] cultures.

Around the [[8th century BGS]] tin-based bronze metallurgy was developed in [[Koty]], the Proto-Hnäzb did not produce any metal on their own and only bought bronze tools and weapons from the hill tribes. The Proto-Hnäzb did not practice any metalwork on their own, as signs of extended use of metal tools shows. While there is some amount of both metal tools and weapons, it is still minuscule compared to central [[Koty]]. Around this time, likely connected to the increasing trade in bronze, first migrations northward appeared. The first migrants north were likely speakers of early [[Namb languages]], which could already have diversified into its [[Northern Namb languages|northern]] and [[Southern Namb languages|southern]] branches. A much more mobile maritime culture spread fast north along coastal [[Krobu]], dubbed the [[Old Krobu Maritime Culture]] (OKM). The likely carriers of Proto-Hnäzb culture spread generally slower during this age and continued a village based pastoralist lifestyle.

By the end of the Proto-Hnäzb period there was a phase of transition, which introduced several important markers of later Hnäzb culture. During the [[2nd century BGS]] the so called [[South-Koyanic Pastoralic Complex]] came into being. This culture saw a very fast spread over a short amount of time and is very likely connected to late Proto-Hnäzb. The SKP migrated from northern [[Koty]] into eastern [[Krobu]].

## Steppe Expansion  (0-300 AGS)

At around 0 AGS a very fast spreading culture existed in southern [[Koyan]]. The carriers of this culture had a very mobile and expansionist lifestyle and both engaged into extensive trade and raiding of coastal settlements. At the same time they increasingly spread northward into the [[Red Steppe]]. The inhabitants of the [[Red Steppe]] prior to this expansion were, amongst others likely speakers of [[Upic languages|Upic languages]]. Their lifestyle in essence resembled that of pre-expansion Proto-Hnäzb. People lived in small tribal communities strewn all over the vast steppes. They also occupied small villages and farmsteads and herded [[ugo]] and engaged in hunting the animals of the steppe. There is no indication of any large polity occupying any part of the steppe. The pre-Hnäzb steppe people also did not practise any metallurgy.

The expansion of early Hnäzb happened in a time frame from around [[Universal calendar|year 0]] until the end of the [[3rd century]]. It introduced a highly mobile tribal elite, which engaged in warfare, raiding, as well as ritual activity for the sake of gaining prestige. Hnäzb storytellers remember this time period as an age of heroes, in which mighty ancestor figures claimed huge areas of land, carried out raids against each other and founded new powerful clans. The first great incursion of Hnäzb into the [[Red Steppe]] occurred in [[1st century|56 AGS]]. Around 100 AGS already it seems that a large polity, be it a single tribe or tribal federation was gaining power in the central steppes. This pattern continued. In 211 AGS the Hnäzb reached the later region of [[Uhustaw]] for the first time. At around 300 AGS the complete area settled by modern Hnäzb speakers was settled already. At the same time, the southernmost extend of Hnäzb culture disappeared as quickly as the rest spread north. In northern [[Koty]] and southern [[Krobu]], speakers of Hnäzb shifted towards [[Arklobu languages]].

## Age of the Great Herds (300-700 AGS)

The main phase of Hnäzb power is called the [[Age of Great Herds]] and lasted from the [[4th century]] through to the early [[8th century]]. The period began with the rise of the great clans, which in Hnäzb historical narratives always numbered 25. What actually made any tribe a great tribe is up to debate and the inclusion or exclusion of one tribe or another is pretty much based on cultural symbolism. In [[4th century|323 AGS]] the tribe of [[Red-Deer]] came to power in the western central steppes. [[Red-Deer]] build a powerful tribal federation. In 331 he became powerful enough to carry out raids into the coastal lowlands. According to songs he waged war against seven powerful cities and subjugated them. This event marked the beginning of a series of conflicts between the steppes and the lowlands. These conflicts shaped both the culture of the lowlands, as well as of the steppes.

During a short lived war in [[6th century|561]] the federation of [[Five-Spears]] carried out an eastward invasion into the [[Murfa people|Murfa]] area. They destroyed the town of [[Phaseta]] and carried its inhabitants off. In the following year they returned, but the people along the [[Murfa river]] fled into the desert and carried out a successive war of attrition against the steppe people, who were quite frankly out of their element. Ambassadors were also sent from [[Murfa]] to [[Ksuray]] in the [[Tyon-Arat]]. Quickly a small garrison was build along the [[Murfa river|Murfa]]. This contact meant, that for the next centuries [[Ardanic people|Ardanians]] were discouraged from any westward exploration and saw the steppe as dangerous place of potential danger. Despite small encounters, where were no further conflicts between the two groups and apart from contacts along the [[Murfa river|Murfa]], [[Ardanic people|Ardanians]] had no further contact with Hnäzbic cultures till the [[9th century]].

In the following centuries several great steppe federations arose and fell again. By the end of the [[7th century]] they became increasingly short lived and betrayal and rebellion was rampant. Great lords rose on one day, to be betrayed and killed on the next. At the same time, the coastal lowlands had become increasingly defensive and could easily fight off invading nomads. Thus the prestige and power of the old lords had come out of reach for many of them. In 645 the last large war between the lowlands cities and the steppe lords occurred. All the cities, which until then had to pay tribute could regain their full independence. The once mighty clan of [[Celestial-Dancer]] was completely destroyed during this conflict and left a power vacuum on the steppes. In the successive decades no powerful lord could claim their position and the steppes descendent into increasing infighting. The great tribes had fallen and no one could take their place any more.

## The Age of Fracturing: 700-900

The age of cultural and political decline which is called the Age of Fracturing began in the early [[8th century]] and lasted until the middle of the [[9th century]]. Only the late [[9th century]] saw a renewed rise in Hnäzb power, but this time mostly connected to an emerging west-[[Fountainhead]] trade network.

The great clans of the Hnäzb split into smaller and smaller clans. Politically there were no new large federations being formed. The old Hnäzb elite went into decline and mostly impoverished, while culture became increasingly more local. On the linguistic side, this loss of political unity also coincided with an increase in linguistic diversification among the [[Hnäzb languages]], although there is no direct cause and effect between these two developments. The Hnäzb tribes which were closest to the [[Nambic peoples|Nambic cultures]] even began to enter a relation of vassalage with some of them.

# Society

## General Lifestyle and Economy

Most Hnäzb were pastoralists who relied on the [[ugo]] and to a lesser extent cattle for their livelihood. While the elite of Hnäzb culture took great pride in their nomadic lifestyle, not all Hnäzb people were nomadic. In fact, there were small towns and settlements everywhere in Hnäzb territory, even in the high steppe, although such settled people were largely impoverished farmers living off planting tubers. The majority of Hnäzb were semi-nomadic and relied on pastoralism; they annually migrated between different pastures. The highest strata of [[Hnäzb social order|Hnäzb society]] were fully nomadic and travelled over vast distances. They relied on tribute from vassal tribes and were mostly concerned with upholding intertribal relations, ritual activity and both trade and war.

## Hierarchy

*Main article: [[Hnäzb social order]]*

[[Hnäzb social order|Hnäzb society]] was highly stratified, mostly based on lifestyle, but still a degree of some social mobility. In fact Hnäzb culture high encouraged people to seek prestige and climb up the social hierarchy. One of the defining factors of [[Hnäzb social order|Hnäzb societal stratification]] was that wealth was measured in ownership of [[ugo]].

The symbolic narrative was that there were five parts to [[Hnäzb social order|Hnäzb society]]. In fact, there were more social groups, with some having almost the character of subethnicities. The five traditional social strata are:

1. [[Ugo-lords]]: A highly mobile, elite warrior class representing the leadership of the clans.
2. [[Star-eyes]]: A priest class who composed epic poetry legitimising the reverence of past heroes and great leaders.
3. Steppe-dwellers: The largest caste, consisting of semi-nomadic pastoralists making annual migrations.
4. [[Knaqh]]-dwellers: Settled farmers living in farmsteads and villages under the control of the [[Ugo-lords]].
5. Outsiders or subdued foreigners.

## Gender

The Hnäzb kept track of both patrilineal and matrilineal lines and assigned different property to each. They believed that divine abilities were inherited through the female line, although they were different in men and women.

According to their beliefs, humans were originally hermaphroditic, but were split into sexes by the gods after the fall of the world tree. There was also an equivalent of the [[Nambō]] [[Nambō#ōsapnē|ōsapnē]]/[[Nambō#ōsapnē|tilibbō]], a third gender which was believed to originate from the convergence of two divine male and female lines and thus could transcend that gender binary. They often belonged to the priest class as they were believed to have special powers. These people, neither male nor female, represented an amendment of the original separation and were thus closer to the divine original humans.

## Religion

*Main article: [[Hnäzb religion]]*

The religion of the Hnäzb people carried the typical hallmarks of any [[Koyanic peoples#Religion|Koyanic religion]] religion, but had several motifs of its own which made it unique.

The cosmology of the Hnäzb is dominated by a five-part worldview. The world consists of five spheres, which are both separated and connected. The uppermost sphere consists of pure light and is the realm of the sun and the moons. The sphere below it is that of the sky, the wind and the clouds, which were thought to be spirits or celestial [[ugo]]. The middle sphere is the earthen sphere, which is inhabited by humans, animals and plants and other beings. Then there is the realm of water and the ocean. Lastly there is a subterranean realm or underworld, which is accessible through caves.

The Hnäzb believed in a multitude of spirits, but the most important of them were ancestor spirits and the [[Ädłäähn]] household spirits. Among the larger gods, there was the sun god called [[Qhatłat']] or "Lord Sun" and the ocean deity called "Queen Ocean". There were further great gods, like the daughters of the moons and the [[ugo]] on the clouds, which grazed on the celestial sphere itself. Although these gods were important for the cosmology and certain daily rituals, they were generally sidelined in most rituals. They represented forces of nature that humans ought to pay respect to, but could not influence in a meaningful way, as they were too powerful to directly interact with anyway. Most Hnäzb religious ceremonies focused more on smaller spirits and deities.

Hnäzb holy places followed two types, the stationary [[Taha]] and the mobile [[Hmııt'aaqh]]. [[Taha]] is a name which was generally given to sacred spaces which could be the locality of village shrines and wayshrines.

## Art and Storytelling

The Hnäzb did not have a written language. Instead, they relied on an oral tradition transmitted by the [[Star-eyes#Sun-moon-singers|Sun-moon-singers]]. Another tool to tell their histories was their traditional art displayed on their houses and within [[Taha]]. These depictions consisted of figures drawn in white on a red background. They were highly abstract in nature and contained a system of iconography.
