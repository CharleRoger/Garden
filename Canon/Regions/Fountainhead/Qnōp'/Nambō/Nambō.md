**Nambō** is a cultural and political region of [[Qnōp']] active during the [[1st millennium|1st]] and [[2nd millennium|2nd]] millennia AGS, reaching from the swampy lowlands to parts of the [[Red steppe]], including the lake region of [[Uhustaw]].

The people of Nambō were never politically unified, but were connected via their shared language, [[Nambāno]], in fact a continuum of mutually-intelligible dialects including varieties like [[Bȳŋ]] and [[Tazoku]]. Speakers of more distinct but closely related languages such as [[Afãba]] may also be included, and even more broadly, other similar groups of [[Namb languages|Namb language]] speakers can be considered part of the greater sphere of Nambō cultural phenomena, most notably the [[Yueyar People|Yueyar]]. Native speakers of [[Nambāno]] were called *nambānajal* "[[Nambāno]]-haver", or described as *nambēni* "by/of [[Nambāno]]".

# Name
*Nambō* is the [[Nambāno]] term for the region, a "unique noun" derived from *namba* "marsh", thus means roughly "The Marshes". This term also lends itself to the name of the language *[[Nambāno]]*, literally "marsh-tongue".

# Culture
## Social stratification
There was no real cultural endonym for the people of Nambō considered as a whole, rather people were primarily thought of as belonging to distinct social classes. There was a similar class hierarchy in [[Krobu]], which like its language and people, was recognised contemporaneously as being closely related to that found in [[Nambō]]. These social categories were also broadly applied to more foreign cultures in order to have some foundation for international relations. For example, [[Hnäzb people|Hnäzb]] chiefs were considered similarly to *ōmōda*, Nambō lords, as governors of their respective regions of the [[Red steppe]] due to the strong connection between a [[Hnäzb people|Hnäzb]] tribe and its land, though their own perspective of land ownership was quite different.

In the earliest history of [[Nambō]], society was stratified into around five or six castes, inherited from the earlier [[Nambic peoples|Nambic]] culture of ancient [[Krobu]]. Later, in the period leading up to and following the [[Qnōp' rebellion]], a cultural belief that each stratum was considered a necessary pillar of civilisation developed, and the canonical number of strata universally settled on five:

1. [[Sakkorājā]] — Priests, lords and certain kinds of scholars.
2. [[Jakkuarasō]] — Soldiers and political officers.
3. [[Huitēglō]] — Scribes, natural philosophers, civic project managers and other skilled workers.
4. [[Ābrējō]] — Farmers, builders, couriers and other labourers.
5. [[Dēmōdō]] — Merchants, entertainers, artists and other craftspeople.

Bird-like dinosaurs were not particularly uncommon In [[Qnōp']], though were typically much smaller and less threatening than the one being mimicked here. To have slain such a creature is an immense achievement, so this outfit is more of a trophy than anything.

## Gender
Four kinds of gender identity were recognised in Nambō: male, female, *ōsapnē* and *tilibbō*.

### Ōsapnē
The vast majority of ōsapnē were people who were born male and started to express a varying degree of typically feminine traits in childhood, through the way they dressed, spoke and their general lifestyle. There were also many qualities attributed specifically to ōsapnē, such as creativity and an affinity for teaching. All societies of Nambō shared the idea that gender is not an immutable characteristic, rather it is something that develops naturally in a person's childhood like any other aspect of identity. Someone assigned female at birth could similarly transition to being male early in life, but such people were just considered male rather than a separate gender like *ōsapnē*. Perhaps as much as 5% of the population of Nambō were *ōsapnē* people.

### Tilibbō
Unlike ōsapnē which was still tied to the male-female gender binary, *tilibbō* was a truly non-binary or genderless identity. It was much rarer than *ōsapnē* and typically only found among the [[Sakkorājā]]. Tilibbō identity was often expressed by the wearing of prosthetic facial hair and the colour white, the latter a symbol of the purity and clarity with which the gender was associated.

## Marriage
Two main types of marriage were practised amongst the peoples of [[Nambō]]: **Knidalla** and **Ēdandraganō**.

### Knidalla
The most common form of marriage was called *Knidalla* "partnership", a simple union of two individuals from different households, forming a new household.

The ceremony was performed over several days by a [[Sakkorājā]] priest, a member of the highest societal caste and included feasts, music, dancing, and burning of old possessions. The celebrations culminated in the announcement of the marriage name, a unique personal sentence-name granted by the priest but usually coined by the couple themselves, and added to both their names. Throughout the festivities, some members of both families would construct a temporary wooden house called a *knēra*, a physical representation of their new household typically decorated with flowers and dyed cloth. The newlyweds would live in the knēra for any length of time after the marriage, usually a few months until a proper farmstead is built.

Although non-heteronormative gender expressions and relationships were fairly commonplace in [[Nambō]], the specific rite concerning the foundation of a household was reserved to a marriage between a man and a woman. Other kinds of partnerships were not prohibited and such couples could even live together, but could not participate in a traditional marriage and therefore could not properly be said to form a household with regards to taxation and political representation.

### Ēdandraganō
Marriage in the elite castes of society followed the same pattern for the most part, but an additional type of marriage called *Ēdandraganō* or *Ēdi Andraganō* "lordly agreement" was also practised. Ēdandraganō was often a political marriage, creating an amicable relationship between potential rival land-owning families and acting as a channel for diplomacy between them. Land was often exchanged as part of the marriage contract. Ēdandraganō marriage does not involve a change of personal names.

The husband and wife had separate households, which could be separate buildings or segregated wings of a larger complex. Each household had its own [[Ābrējō|domestic workers]] who lived on the premises and, for those of particular importance, a retinue of [[Āsamājā|advisors]]. Generally only women and third-gender [[Nambō#Ōsapnē|ōsapnē]] people were allowed in the wife's household, while only men were allowed in the husband's, except his wife who had the special and asymmetrical privilege to enter both. [[Nambō#Tilibbō|Tilibbō]] individuals were considered genderless and thus were allowed in both, though such people were uncommon and would have mostly been familial relatives. Children born from the marriage were generally raised in their mother's household.

Ēdandraganō was especially unusual in that it also involved a third party, simply called *sessagō* "second", whose role was traditionally to replace the husband in the event of his death. This was said to have originated in the semi-legendary Age of Kings, during which rulers frequently died in battle or by assassination, though men of the elite typically married younger women, so it was commonplace for them to die significantly before their wives even during the long peace.

Even before the death of the husband, the sessagō was very much involved in the marriage. They were naturally most commonly a young man, but this was apparently not as restrictive as the basic constraints on a marriage, also allowing [[Nambō#Ōsapnē|ōsapnē]] people, and very occasionally women. The sessagō, like the wife, had the special privilege to enter both households, and it was not uncommon for them to have a sexual relationship with either or both of the husband and wife, and especially later in history their place within the marriage became more symmetrical. Although the marriage contract was formally ended upon the death of the wife, in such a premature event the husband and sessagō usually continued living together.

Ēdandraganō does not strictly involve a change of personal names, but the titles *ōmōda* "lord", *ōmōdāma* "lady" and *sessagō* are granted.
