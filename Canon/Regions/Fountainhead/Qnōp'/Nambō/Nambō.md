**Nambō** is a cultural and political region of [[Qnōp']] active during the [[1st millennium|1st]] and [[2nd millennium|2nd]] millennia AGS, reaching from the swampy lowlands to parts of the [[Red steppe]], including the lake region of [[Uhustaw]].

The people of Nambō were never politically unified, but were connected via their shared language, [[Nambāno]], in fact a continuum of mutually-intelligible dialects including varieties like [[Bȳŋ]] and [[Tazoku]]. Speakers of more distinct but closely related languages such as [[Afãba]] may also be included, and even more broadly, other similar groups of [[Namb languages|Namb language]] speakers can be considered part of the greater sphere of Nambō cultural phenomena, most notably the [[Yueyar]]. Native speakers of [[Nambāno]] were called *nambānajal* "[[Nambāno]]-haver", or described as *nambēni* "by/of [[Nambāno]]".

# Name
*Nambō* is the [[Nambāno]] term for the region, a "unique noun" derived from *namba* "marsh", thus means roughly "The Marshes". This term also lends itself to the name of the language *[[Nambāno]]*, literally "marsh-tongue".

# Culture
## Social stratification
There was no real cultural endonym for the people of Nambō considered as a whole, rather people were primarily thought of as belonging to distinct social classes. There was a similar class hierarchy in [[Krobu]], which like its language and people, was recognised contemporaneously as being closely related to that found in [[Nambō]]. These social categories were also broadly applied to more foreign cultures in order to have some foundation for international relations. For example, [[Hnäzb people|Hnäzb]] chiefs were considered similarly to *ōmōda*, Nambō lords, as governors of their respective regions of the [[Red steppe]] due to the strong connection between a [[Hnäzb people|Hnäzb]] tribe and its land, though their own perspective of land ownership was quite different.

In the earliest history of [[Nambō]], society was stratified into around five or six castes, inherited from the earlier [[Nambic peoples|Nambic]] culture of ancient [[Krobu]]. Later, in the period leading up to and following the [[Qnōp' rebellion]], a cultural belief that each stratum was considered a necessary pillar of civilisation developed, and the canonical number of strata universally settled on five:

1. [[Sakkorājā]] — Priests, lords and certain kinds of scholars.
2. [[Jakkuarasō]] — Soldiers and political officers.
3. [[Huitēglō]] — Scribes, natural philosophers, civic project managers and other skilled workers.
4. [[Ābrējō]] — Farmers, builders, couriers and other labourers.
5. [[Dēmōdō]] — Merchants, entertainers, artists and other craftspeople.

Bird-like dinosaurs were not particularly uncommon In [[Qnōp']], though were typically much smaller and less threatening than the one being mimicked here. To have slain such a creature is an immense achievement, so this outfit is more of a trophy than anything.
> - A [[Nambō#Tilibbō|genderless]] [[ōmōda]], a member of the land-owning arm of the [[Sakkorājā]]. Their moustache-like nose piercing and prosthetic beard are characteristic of [[Nambō#Tilibbō|tilibbō]] style, as is the plain white colour of their robe.

## Gender
Four kinds of gender identity were recognised in Nambō: male, female, *ōsapnē* and *tilibbō*.

## Ōsapnē
The vast majority of ōsapnē were people who were born male and started to express a varying degree of typically feminine traits in childhood, through the way they dressed, spoke and their general lifestyle. There were also many qualities attributed specifically to ōsapnē, such as creativity and an affinity for teaching. All societies of Nambō shared the idea that gender is not an immutable characteristic, rather it is something that develops naturally in a person's childhood like any other aspect of identity. Someone assigned female at birth could similarly transition to being male early in life, but such people were just considered male rather than a separate gender like *ōsapnē*. Perhaps as much as 5% of the population of Nambō were *ōsapnē* people.

## Tilibbō
Unlike ōsapnē which was still tied to the male-female gender binary, *tilibbō* was a truly non-binary or genderless identity. It was much rarer than *ōsapnē* and typically only found among the [[Sakkorājā]]. Tilibbō identity was often expressed by the wearing of prosthetic facial hair and the colour white, the latter a symbol of the purity and clarity with which the gender was associated.
