**Mōhuānō** (from [[Nambāno]] *mō-huā-nō* "hundred-count-ing") numerals are a family of related written numeral systems originating from [[Qnōp']] which were used by many cultures in the region throughout history. They are characterised by a set of common operating principles, regardless of the actual form of the numeral signs and the written languages they are used alongside.
# Principles
Mōhuānō numeral systems tend to adhere to the following principles:
1. The basic value-carrying signs follows a base 10 pattern and usually have a sub-base of 5, with signs for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 10 at the very least.
2. If a larger numeral appears immediately before a smaller numeral, they add together.
3. If a smaller numeral appears immediately before a larger numeral, they multiply together. Generally the larger number will be a power of ten (10, 100, etc), though exceptions can be found.
4. A given numeral can only appear as the larger multiplier once in a single number.
5. Equal numerals never appear in sequence.
6. All multiplication is done first, then addition.

Here's a functional illustration using a combination of Arabic and Roman numerals for a bit of familiarity:
- **V1** = 5+1 = 6
- **X2** = 10+2 = 12
- **2X** = 2×10 = 20
- **3CVX1** = (3×100)+(5×10)+1 = 351
- **6X** = 6×10 or **LX** = 50+10 are two ways to represent 60, depending on which signs are available in the particular system.

Some invalid formations:
- **1V** would denote 1 × 5, but the **1** is redundant so is never found in this position.
- **V1X** would denote 5 × (1 × 10), not (5 + 1) × 10, so similarly does not appear
- **3X3X** also does not write 60 because the **X** is used as the larger multiplier twice, which is not allowed, so this can only be read as simply the number 30 written twice
# History
## Origin
The earliest written numerals found in [[Qnōp']] long predate the presence of linguistic writing, taking the form of tallies with additional signs for 5 and 10, and certain signs with context-dependent values. These numeric markings are found on [[orkolith|orkoliths]] (oath-stones), ancient standing stones scattered throughout [[Qnōp']] believed to mark important ritual transactions or legal settlements, and inspiring mysticism and reverence from later cultures. The apparent age of these [[orkolith|orkoliths]], as well as similarities between the forms of early Mōhuānō numerals and those used in [[T'ugü]], strongly suggests these numerals were first used by the [[Upic peoples]] who settled on [[Red Steppe|the steppe]] in the [[2nd millennium BGS]], though the Mōhuānō system itself did not develop until after the [[Koyanic peoples|Koyanic]] expansion.

## Maturation
The multiplicative rules which define Mōhuānō numerals arose in the late [[1st millennium BGS]], having matured into a coherent system by [[Universal calendar|year 0]]. This development coincides with the introduction of the first writing to [[Qnōp']], believed to have been transmitted via bronze trade with peoples of [[Oksandanderi]], though direct connections between scripts are obscure at best. Numerals became much more widely used in this period, mostly in the form of clay tablets recording trade and debt and perhaps an early form of taxation in what might have been nascent city-states, before the first bronze age ended with the arrival of the [[Koyanic peoples]].

> 100+(2×10)+5=125; 10+2=12
> 2×100=200; (3×10)+5=35

The numeral systems in [[Qnōp']] were fairly uniform in function at this time, consisting of signs for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 50 and 100 and following the principles laid out above. The style of signs varied from place to place, but generally used the same pictographic symbols:
- Tally marks or dots from 1 to 4
- A hand or fist for 5
- An eye for 10
- The moon or an [[ugo]] antler for 50
- An [[ugo]] head or pair of antlers for 100

Signs for 500 and 1,000 were also occasionally used until around the [[4th century]] AGS, usually depicting the sun and a tree either alone or in combination, though exhibiting much more variation.
