**Sakkorājā** was the highest caste of [[Nambō]], consisting of priests, lords, and certain kinds of scholars.

Their role was to keep life in [[Nambō]] ticking along, and ensure the continued development of culture and knowledge. This latter idea was influenced by [[Lavondu]] practices and beliefs, though there is an emphasis on progress and growth rather than just preservation. [[Qnōp']] was divided into portions of land called [[tōtrēma]], each belonging to an [[ōmōda]] (lord) from some noble family. The inhabitants of the [[tōtrēma]] were not owned by the [[ōmōda]], but did work in their service in exchange for their protection and continued peaceful existence, and were often otherwise compensated in some irregular way by the [[ōmōda]], depending on their own social class. Noble families could have several [[ōmōda]] and could exchange land through strategic [[Nambō#Marriage|marriage]].
