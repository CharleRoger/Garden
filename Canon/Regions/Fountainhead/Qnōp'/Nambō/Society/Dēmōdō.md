**Dēmōdō** were merchants, entertainers, artists and other craftspeople considered as a [[Nambō]] social caste.

Dēmōdō are producers of culture who typically worked alone or in small groups, without any particular affiliations or obligations. While the [[Nambō#Social stratification|other four strata]] formed a definite hierarchy, the Dēmōdō is somewhat adjacent to the whole system, though was sometimes considered between [[Huitēglō]] and [[Ābrējō]]. These were people who do not rely on any state directly and mostly supported themselves through their trade. Most immigrants or other travellers were Dēmōda, even those from afar with no connection to [[Nambō]] society. Despite their independence, it was generally considered that without them, civilisation would stagnate and humanity would regress to an earlier, less-developed state.
