The Yueyar are a people residing primarily on the coastal areas of the southern [[Nambō]] lowlands, found north of the Senjeppo peninsula, within [[Qnōp']] - an area they call **Yuenomvŕ**. They are part of the [[Nambic peoples]] culture group, but speak the [[Yueyar Language]] instead of [[Nambāno]].

The Yueyar people see themselves as inherently part of the Nambō cultural and political sphere, however they have notable cultural, political, and religious differences.
# Culture
## Societal Strata
Like many of their neighbours and their cultural and linguistical cousins, Yueyar society is split into distinct social classes. Unlike the rest of the Nambō cultural sphere, the Yueyar recognize 7 strata.
1. [[Yokrattasŕ]] - High Priesthood
2. [[Sīmuesŕ]] - Nobility
3. [[Xovvasŕ]] - Priesthood & Soldiers
4. [[Yokrigxŕ]] - Civic Workers & Craftspeople
5. [[Omssŕ]] - Labourers
6. [[Xōmuhŕ]] - Travellers & Entertainers
7. [[Tmisŕ]] - Exiles, Criminals, & Merchants

Movement between strata is difficult in Yueyar society. For example, to join the Sīmuesŕ, one must either marry into an existing noble house or acquire enough wealth to own both an estate and a parcel of workable land as well as learn a difficult and time consuming craft and petition the Yokrattasŕ to recognize it as artisanal. The most reliable way to move up is to devote yourself to the Xovvasŕ, however most Omsŕ have familial and communal pressure to remain and assist with the harvest and other labours that need to be done.

All strata, except Tmisŕ, Yokrattasŕ, and Xōmuhŕ, are inherited from parents. Having parentage in the Tmisŕ may lead to negative social occurrences however. The default strata, with exceptions, is the Omssŕ.

As the Xōmuhŕ lies somewhere outside the strata, it can freely be entered by anyone in any strata. However, those in the Xōmuhŕ cannot [[#Marriage & Societal Strata|marry]], and the same is true for those in the Yokrattasŕ and Xovvasŕ. They are still free to love, though, and have children. Marriage to the Yueyar is a commitment to stay in one place and in one community.
The Xōmuhŕ are actually highly respected by the Yueyar, as they value joy and a diversity of experiences, both of which the Xōmuhŕ are believed to experience and share in spades.

While the Yueyar might have landed nobility, they do not enjoy the same power as the [[ōmōda]] of the wider Nambano strata. Instead, {Land-parcel} are governed by a council of Yokrattar - wise people entrenched in the religious aspect of Yueyar society.
Yokrattar rule until death, after which a successor takes over. A council always has the same number of Yokrattar on it, though that exact number varies between {land-parcel} and can even be changed by a vote of all of the priesthood of a {land-parcel}. The way a successor is appointed varies, even between Yokrattar in the same council. There are two methods that are seen as the most valid, however: Choosing and training your own successor before your death, or letting all of the priesthood of the {Land-parcel} vote on a successor. In the case of the former, a Yokrattar is free to choose anyone from any strata with their consent, though choosing from the Tmisŕ often results in that successor being looked down upon until enough time has passed, though it sometimes also results in the Yokrattar themself being seen as more virtuous. In the case of the latter, the successor can only be chosen by someone already within the priesthood.

The Yokrattasŕ do not believe themselves arbiters of the will of the divine, nor do they believe themselves to inherently know more than the people they have been tasked to govern. They often choose to seek counsel from the many Sīmuesŕ families under their rule, and those families are often expected to actively listen to and engage with the problems of the workers who live on their lands.

As a stratum, the Yokrattasŕ are composed of the ruling council as well as other important members of the priesthood, such as those tasked with understanding the signs of the divine, and those tasked with teaching new members how to be a priest.
### Marriage & Societal Strata
In Yueyar culture, an Omsŕ is allowed to live and work on a {Land-parcel} because it is their ancestral right. A Sīmues is not allowed to evict an Omsŕ who lives on their {Land-parcel} with an ancestral right to be there, however they are allowed to evict a Xōmuh who decided to settle down and become an Omsŕ on that {Land-parcel}. There are two main ways to obtain an ancestral right, either you inherit it from one of your parents, or you marry someone with an ancestral right.

To the Yueyar, marriage is not a binding oath of monogamy, it is not the ultimate outcome of romantic pursuits, and it is not seen as a prerequisite for sexual relations. It is still seen as a romantic endeavour, however. Marriage is more an oath to the {Land-parcel}, it represents settling down and a promise that you will work for these lands and be one with the community.

Yokrattar, Xovvar, and Tmis are all forbidden from marriage. For a Xovvar, they are seen as incapable of this oath to the {Land-parcel} as they are already devoted to their cause or to the faith and the community in their own way. For a Tmis, they are simply banned from marriage as they are seen as undesirable to the community or untrustworthy.

If a Xōmuh marries, they immediately adopt the stratum of their spouse. The Xōmuhŕ are inherently untethered and free, and marriage is inherently a tether to the Yueyar. This also means a married individual cannot become Xōmuhŕ. There is no expectation by the Yueyar for a married couple to produce children. While they may be expected to do more work in regards to the communal child raising, they themselves are not inherently expected to make more children. As this is the case, the Yueyar have no stigma against queer marriages, and they are not seen as any different to straight marriages.

For the Sīmuesŕ, marriage is viewed under a different lens, as they have different expectations to relationships, oaths, duty, and children. Whereas for the Omssŕ, marriage is an oath to the {Land-parcel} and your fellow community that work its fields, for the Sīmuesŕ marriage is an oath to your family, its craft, and its future. A Sīmues does not need to marry another Sīmues, and depending on the family this may be frowned upon if it would lead to both families having to pass down their trade secrets to the same line. Instead, some families expect their heir to marry a Xōmuh, or a very skilled Yokrigx, and if the union itself could not produce children they are expected to find a partner who already has a child or to produce a child by other means, if they are the heir to the family trade secret. The further removed a Sīmues is to being the heir of the family, the less important it is who they marry, but also the more likely it is they will be expected to join the Xovvasŕ in some form or another.

As marriage to the Yueyar is never an oath of monogamy to a person, extramarital affairs are permitted with no social stigma. Whether this is a long term partnership, an ephemeral romance, or another partner to live with, they are all seen as equal relations even to that of a married couple. However, a person can only marry one person as you cannot make two oaths to a {Land-parcel} or community, even if it is to the one you already made an oath to. For a long term domestic partner to someone who is married, they have a protection from eviction called the right to love. This is a weaker protection than the ancestral right, and can be nullified by a Yokrattar if a Sīmues petitions them for it.
## Religion
The Yueyar worship multiple deities. Many of their stories are codified, such as the [[Yueyar Creation Myth]].

Yueyar deities share tropes with other Koyanic cultures, such as...

The Yueyar priesthood is composed of all members of the Yokrattasŕ and Xovvasŕ, even those devoted to military means.

In Yueyar culture members of the priesthood or other religious figures roles is not to preach and enforce the unceasing uninterpretable word of the divine but instead to help people figure out and understand reality. While there are divine texts or well known tales, the Yueyar are not under the impression that it is the direct word of the divine. Instead, they are aware of the lens of humankind the text or story is being told through, and that such texts and stories are up to interpretation. Often, religion is expressed through conversation and questioning to achieve a mutual and deeper understanding of the world.
