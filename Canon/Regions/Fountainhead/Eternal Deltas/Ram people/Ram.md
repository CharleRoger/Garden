Speakers of the Ram languages. The Ram people have a strict worldview often unrelated to the rest of the eternal deltas worldview, but they share a few things, likely gods and rituals. 

# Lifestyle 
Settled in both continental land and islands near by it, the Ram people are known to live their lives very distinctively, they are often portrait as man of works and arts, because their monumental structures can be seen from afar, they honor their gods differently than the vast majority of people. Their calendar reflects this relationship with the sun and seasons and thus is assumed to be solar. Their clothing style is similar of what a naked man is thought. 

# Belief 
Differently from the vast majority, ram people seem to be secretive about their gods, they are often painted and cited in literature, but people do not speak loudly of their good deeds or wrongdoings. Their gods are portraited like the wind, the river stream or the ocean, they believe in a transcendent energy flow that permeates the universe and so it may manifest in the shape of the godly individuals, so called **Ã”y** "god, spirit, flow, energy, divine entity".
