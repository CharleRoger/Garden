# Proto City States (c. 1000-500 BGS)

The Upper [[Lāēde river]] has been for most of the history of Khey one of the most important aspects for life to thrive in the desert landscape. It helped many early tribes develop the works of agriculture and animal husbandry. It is estimated the Khey desert has been inhabited by humans for thousands of years, the climate was much less arid and large regions were covered by Savannah traversed by herds of grazing ungulates. Foliage and fauna were far more prolific in all environments. Hunting would have been common for early settlers, and this is also the period when many animals were first domesticated. 

By about 1000 BGS, many city states rose in power.

Small tribes living in the [[Lāēde valley]] had developed into a series of cultures demonstrating firm control of agriculture and animal husbandry. The largest of these cultures was the Ada, they were known for their technological and advanced agriculture techniques adapted for that landscape. Following this trend the [[Kátic]] and [[Rharnic]] cultures [[Rotak language]] & [[Rabak language]] people, one of the first to inhabit the desert shared goods and agricultural knowledge with other cultures.

The [[Para-Ardanic people|Ada]]  was followed by the [[Khufkhey]] culture [Early mixed Koyanic-Dreic culture], the [[Tili culture]] [Early Dreic culture]. Over a period of one thousand years the [[Khufkhey]] developed into a powerful civilization that accumulated wealth and power enough to establish their center of power at [Holy City yet to be named].

Warfare was glorified by the [[Khufkhey]], they waged war against many cities eventually forging the kingdom of [Insert name here], a theocratic state based on slavery. However the subjugated people fought against the kingdom, leading to the fracturing of the kingdom.

The [[Khufkey]] and [[Tili culture]] were followed by the [[Vakeye]] and [[Ekerre cultures]]. 

# Temple Era (c. 500-300 BGS)

As economic instability reigns in Khey desert, after the failure of the [[Khufkhey]] Proto-Kingdom many tribesmen become more isolated, their identity distinguished through religion molded their societal values, leading to eventual cultural conflicts between tribes. But among them all, there was the belief of the promised land claimed to be the big rock [[Fkey]] at the center of the [[Khey desert]].

However conflicting claims about the promised land, led many priests and tribesmen to fight among themselves for an unclarified cause, the fracture of religion and the people resulted in the assassination of many leaders and kings, the vacuum of power submerged the people into chaos once again.

A period of silence followed, as the desert became drier and inhospitable for a few years.

# Reconstruction period (c. 200-100 BGS)

Despite almost two hundred years of silence in the desert, the desert has once more become more manageable and fertile, during this time the first coalition of cities was created, a cooperative region between peoples with similar language, culture and tradition, the only distinguishing feature being their city Patron deity. These coalitions of cities existed between the [[Khufkhey]], [[Tili]], [[Ada]], [[Vakeye]], [[Ekerre]], [[Katic]] and [[Ħautar delûr|Ħautaric]] peoples, not as attempts to form a new empire, but as a slow pacing beginnings from the last period of extreme drought that swept across the desert.

# Split of the coalition (c. 100 BGS-60 AGS)

- 100 BGS
	- The desert became liveable again, cities sprung and many cultures managed to survive the great dry period. 

- 50 BGS
	- Across the desert many city states dotted the land, and so proto kingdoms were back again.
- 0
The later split of the First coalition was a graduate process that happened after each city state began to fight for land and resources as the desert became drier. Three alliances were forged, the [[Hayalam Alliance]], Polo Alliance and Kuho Alliance were theocratic states that for many years fought among themselves.

- Circa 130~ AGS [[Hayalam]], [[Polo]] and [[Kuho]] collapsed, many cities were abandoned and left astray. 
    
- In 200 AGS Xu’itfa a successful warlord, conquered the Khey desert, he founded the [[Byo clan]], in 240AGS he died, the Byo clan then fractured.
    
- Circa 360AGS the Byo clan got control of most of cities in Khey, the clan soon took over the control of all cities, no surprise clan Byo would take over the desert, they founded the Desert Concil [[Deyou Volotu]] formed by other ancient and new clans that take over their region of the desert but never having more power than the clan Byo.
