*xal* /xɑl/ was a [[Rantag]] word that was the closest equivalent to the English word "holy". However, the word had a wider range of meanings. Inititially, the word meant "set apart".
## Etymology

*xal* was from the archaic Rantag verb *xaly*, which meant "to separate", "to set apart". This verb corresponded to the standard (Totky) Rantag *xaloty* with the same meaning, formed from the former using the suffix -ot, originally a frequentative ending. While *xaly* was rarely if ever used in standard Rantag, *xal* remained a common word with a specialized sense, distinct from the derivatives of *xaloty*.
## Development
#### Early Ran practice

The original meaning of *xal* is best understood by ancient Ran ritual practices. When eating, drinking, or more generally benefitting from something, it was common to set apart a part of it as a gift to a god. For example, a family eating bread might have separated a piece with the intent to later deliver the piece to the sea as a gift to Pilur. Gifts like these were thought to please the gods and bring prosperity. 

Such a piece of bread, after being separated, would've been considered xal, "set apart". Even before the delivery of the piece, restrictions would have applied to the behaviour that could be shown towards it. For example, holding it with dirty hands or damaging it would've been against cultural mores. Eating the piece would have been scandalous, probably leading to harsh punishment of some sort.

It is possible that the prohibition originated from not wishing to make displeasing what was to be later given to the gods. Later on, in any case, the ownership of a xal thing was considered to already transfer to the gods the moment it was set apart, even when it was not physically given to them yet. From such a perspective, the prohibitions were rules against damaging the property of gods. Though it is unlikely this view was the original, requiring rather developed views of property, the invention must've still been early, being common in sources of the times.
### Expansion

The idea of being xal was increasingly expanded beyond the original ritual context starting around 4th century BGS. This might have been driven by the development
### Philosophy: Are the gods xal?

The gradual development of the concept is attested in the religious debate around gods being xal. While this debate was mostly restricted to the Feculky of the early first century AGS, the winning view would spread all around Pilam. One side had a narrower view of xal, viewing sacrificial offerings to gods as xal (this was common to both sides), but not considering the gods themselves as xal. According polemicists, those disagreeing with this view dishonored the gods by likening them to the earthly objects given to them (or taken by them). The other side used xal in a wider sense, where it corresponded more generally to divinity and holiness. The polemicists of this side considered the first side to be guilty of pedantry and of dishonoring the gods, this time by likening them to profane things. 

The first side was more likely to be the original, as all known descriptions of the gods as xal postdate the Great Syzygy, and as this understanding of xal seems closer to its ritual roots. Nonetheless the latter side would eventually prevail. Denying that the gods were xal was eventually made illegal in the late first century, though the debate was already over at this point. It is unclear why this view won out, though it is possibly related to emergence of more secular kinds of philosophy in Feculky and the numerous political changes, whereas the old view was associated with extremist totyq and the old establishment. An influential piece of text from this time, written by a young tot of Fecul, polemically details the controversy from the latter perspective.

"The Blind" and "the Wise" would come to be the standard titles for the sides of the debate in Feculky.
