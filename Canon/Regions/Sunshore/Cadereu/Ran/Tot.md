A **tot** (early: /tɑ:t/) was a religious official in the societies of the [[Ran peoples]]. The plural was *totyq* (*early:* /tɑ:tuq/). Totyq were a core part of [[Ran polytheism]] since the beginning, evolving with it. 

Originally, the word *tot* was reserved for men, with archaic *nom* (*early*: /nɑ:m/) being the equivalent for women. However, *tot* came to replace *nom* in most contexts, perhaps owing to its higher status; first documented female adopters of *tot* generally held leadership positions.
## Etymology
The word *tot* is generally thought to derive from the archaic *tatta*, the word for father. Likewise, *nom* is thought to derive from *namma*, an archaic word for mother. (In later [[Rantag]], the words related *icat* and *inan* with the fossilized honorific i- were used for father and mother, though baby-speak reportedly had *tata* and *mama*.) 
## Development
### Origins 
The origins of totyq and nomyq remain unclear. Based on the etymology and archaelogical evidence, it has been proposed that the roles originate from rituals performed within families. Originally, a tot and a nom would have literally been the father and the mother performing a ritual in the context of a family. In larger gatherings, which in Ran culture would have included grandparents and cousins, only one of the fathers, typically the grandfather or a son picked by him, would have taken on the role of performing the ritual. With the formation of settlements and larger communities, and the accompanying changes in the structure of rituals from private to more public, the role would've gotten limited to certain branches of families. 

The increasing specialization might have restricted the position even further, making candidates hard to come across and seeking a bride harder. Being adopted as the son of an existing tot might have increased as a result. In any case, starting at around 350 BGS, with the increasing emphasis on being holy / separate from wordly matters ([[xal]]), ritual adoption became the predominant and eventually sole method of perpetuating the offices of tot and nom. The change seems to have begun in the north-east, near Serquky, and completed last in Kypky, where instances of married nomyq are known as late as 200 BGS. 

However, the idea of totyq originating directly originating from the roles of ordinary fathers and mothers in rituals has been criticized as implausible and too conjectural. While *totyq* seem to have commonly had biological children in the past, many of whom became *totyq* themselves, there isn't enough evidence to say this was overwhelmingly the main way of perpetuating the office; most sources are silent on such matters, and even then they are typically from decades or centuries after the events. It is relatively common for religious positions or titles to be based on the words for parents, yet this isn't typically taken to mean a literal origin from parenthood. 

### The seekers of *xal*
Seeking separation and holiness were not limited to the aforementioned abstinance from procreation. 

# Tot Cenuk
A **Tot Cenuk** "high tot" (plural *Totyq Cenukyq*) was a superior rank of tot. In Totky, it was awarded to leading totyq of conquered areas, the purpose being centralization and easier governance.
# Tot Cenukki
The **Tot Cenukki** "highest tot" (plural *Totyq Cenukkiq*) was the highest ranking tot, to which all Totyq Cenukyq and other totyq in the city-state were subordinate. The position was initially that of a "first among equals", though it evolved away from that, first de facto and then de jure. 

It was common for a Tot Cenukki to also wield considerable secular power. Such was the case with the position of the Tot Cenukki of [[Taspi]], whose powers rivaled even those of the king. In [[Totky]], the successor state of Taspi, the two Totyq Cenukkiq led the state in a theocracy. Though [[Feculky]] was ruled by kings for most of its existence, this briefly changed during the [[Totky#Feculky uprising|Feculky uprising]] when the totyq overthrew the puppet king, installing a Tot Cenukki of their own as the leader of the state.
