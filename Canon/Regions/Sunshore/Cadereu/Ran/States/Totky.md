**Totky** (*early*: /ta:tku/, *late*: /totkɨ/) was a [[Ran peoples|Ran]] state formed from the cities of [[Taspi]] and [[Kypky]] and surrounding areas from 86 AGS.
## Language
The language spoken in Totky was a regional variant of [[Rantag]]. With the increase in Totky's prominence, this variant went on to be widely spoken along the coasts of [[Pilam]], being considered the standard.
# History
## From monarchy to theocracy
[[Melna|Melna's]] [[Taspi-Kypky wars#Coup of 74 AGS|coup of 74 AGS]] had failed to reduce the [[Tot#Tot Cenukki|Tot Cenukki's]] power in the long term and the counter-coup triggered by it had lead to even further losses of the kings' authority. Now, the two [[Tot#Tot Cenukki|Totyq Cenukkiq]] together wielded power over the entire governance. The [[Tot#Tot Cenukki|Tot Cenukki]] of [[Taspi]] held great control over the religious and civil affairs of the entire state. The [[Tot#Tot Cenukki|Tot Cenukki]] of [[Kypky]] had control over the military, and had the final say about religious affairs in [[Kypky]].

During the reign of the new king, [[Laxo]], he and the [[Tot#Tot Cenukki|Totyq Cenukkiq]] ruled the state as a powerful triumvirate. However, [[Laxo]] occasionally returned to [[Kypky]], where his son [[Kyrna]] was viceroy. When he was in [[Kypky]], he was supreme and could overrule his son. During these visits, the [[Tot#Tot Cenukki|Totyq Cenukkiq]] acted as the real rulers of [[Taspi]] and led the governing council in the king's absence. In the later years of the [[Laxo|Laxo's]] reign, when his health worsened, the [[Tot#Tot Cenukki|Totyq Cenukkiq]] came to lead the council even when king was in [[Taspi]].

Upon the death of the king, the two [[Tot#Tot Cenukki|Totyq Cenukkiq]] consolidated power by launching a series of reforms. The king's successor, [[Kyrna]], had almost no real authority. The [[Tot#Tot Cenukki|Totyq Cenukkiq]] were in control of the religious affairs, the civil administration, and the military. Though not wielding much political power, [[Kyrna]] still inherited much of his father's wealth, including the ownership of the king's palace. [[Kyrna]] spent even more time in [[Kypky]] than his predecessor, and set a precedent by only rarely attending meetings of the ruling council. His successors would gradually leave [[Taspi]] for good, ruling in [[Kypky]].

Though used unofficially before [[Laxo|Laxo's]] death, the term [[Totky]] (literally, "tot city-state") was adopted to refer to the state as a whole. The term was adopted to increase unity, as the old name [[Taspi]] was often used to refer solely to the areas on the southern peninsula, in contrast to [[Kypky]].

## Colonies
As time went on, Totky began creating increasing amounts of trade outposts around [[Pilam]], the inland sea. This phenomenon was not unique to Totky, as other states in the ocean also did likewise. However, due to the positioning of Totky, it was the only naval [[Ran peoples|Ran]] state able to create outposts outside the inland sea as well. Over time, these trade outposts became increasingly akin to colonies. As a side effect of their creation, traders from Totky ended up spreading aspects of their religion into new lands. Likewise, the religion of Totky was influenced by the local religions. The main rival of Totky at the time was [[Feculky]], which also created colonies around the inland sea. However, [[Feculky]] possessed a significant land army, unlike Totky.

Over time, these colonies grew, eventually resulting in domination of the internal sea by Totky and [[Feculky]]. Rivalries between the two states escalated, beginning with the Totky conquest of the [[Feculky]] colony [[Pixal]] in 156 AGS, and resulting in the [[Feculky]] conquest of the Totky colony [[Serquky]] in 163 AGS. [[Feculky]] also expanded on land, adopting the goal of trying to connect its colonies along the coast. With the escalation of rivalries, many states in the Ran cultural area allied themselves with one of the two dominant powers.

Unlike [[Taspi]] and [[Kypky]], the colonies of Totky were both de facto and de jure under the control of the [[Tot#Tot Cenukki|Totyq Cenukkiq]]. This benefitted the position of the [[Tot#Tot Cenukki|Totyq Cenukkiq]]. At the time, [[Taspi]] and [[Kypky]] were nominally ruled by the kings of Totky, who resided in [[Kypky]]. However, while the kings were indeed the de facto rulers of [[Kypky]], the [[Tot#Tot Cenukki|Totyq Cenukkiq]] held more sway in most of [[Taspi]]. As a general trend, the [[Tot#Tot Cenukki|Totyq Cenukkiq]] were on the rise. The ongoing shift was reflected by the fact that the rulers of colonies were allowed to use the term *tir* "king", originally used for the leader of a tribe or a settlement) instead of *tirqela* "viceroy". Tir would have been unacceptable in the monarchical period, evidenced by the fact that the rulers of [[Kypky]] were called *tirqelaq*. However, in the new theocratical period, tir was not held to necessarily refer to the supreme authority.

Many of the deities of the colonies were imported back into Totky, where they became more prominent parts of the pantheon, with their own cults. A doctrine emerged that as incarnations of the supreme principle (the [[Moferrumca Xal]] — the divine siblinghood), the two [[Moferrumca Xal|Moferrumyq Xalyq]] (the divine siblings) — [[Pilur]] and [[Kyp]] (the tutelary deities of [[Taspi]] and [[Kypky]] respectively), were "first among equals" among the gods, and leaders of the pantheon. The [[Tot#Tot Cenukki|Totyq Cenukkiq]] were considered the incarnation of the [[Moferrumca Xal]] on [[Winter]].

## First Totky-Feculky war

*See: [[Totky-Feculky wars]]*

The war began with Feculky having the upper hand, attacking northwards and overwhelming Totky's colonies. However, this left the southern areas weak. The king of Kypky managed to bypass Feculky's defences through the mountains and defeated most of the southern army in a crucial fight, allowing him to advance to the capital of Feculky and take it. This caused much of the northern Feculky expeditionary force to be pulled to meet the thread, allowing Totky to defeat the remnants and give pursuit. Feculky's forces, having struggled to break into their own capital, suddenly found themselves at trouble with the arrival of Totky's northern forces. Using the sea and the city walls to their advantage, Totky encircled most of Feculky's army in a costly manoueuvre. Once Kypky's forces occupying the capital joined the battlefield in support of their allies, panic set in and Feculky surrendered. The military fight was over, but the political one was just beginning.
## Feculky uprising

### Background
- Weak puppet king
- Major Totky, especially Kypky, influence in Feculky politics.
- Younger generation unsatisfied, including many totyq
- "The Young" - a name for such totyq
- Movement to embrace traditional Feculky culture in contrast to Totky's culture
- Feculky religion and totyq held in especially high importance.
- Opportunity: conflict between the king of Kypky and the Totyq Cenukkiq
### Consequences
- Riots, protests, eventual support in the military
- Weak king of Feculky replaced with a Tot Cenukki of their own
- "A national rebirth", in a way
- Conflict against Totky, initial success
- Failure
- Occupation, supression of Fecul's cult, city renamed to Kyxal.

# Religion
*See: [[Ran peoples#Religion]]*
## Siblinghood
Religion shifted with the nomination of the [[tot]] of [[Kypky]] as a [[Tot#Tot Cenukki|Tot Cenukki]]. Previously, the state had emphasized the worship of [[Pilur]] over the worship of other deities, which was however still both common and allowed. With the nomination of a second [[Tot#Tot Cenukki|Tot Cenukki]], [[Kyp]] gained a more equal position to [[Pilur]] in the pantheon. Although it took time to catch on with the general populace, the state soon began equally emphasizing the worship of [[Kyp]].

The doctrine of equality between the two deities became an influential one. Another doctrine that gained ground was the principle of siblinghood. The nature of the two deities' relationship as siblings was admired and increasingly highlighted. The role of the [[Tot#Tot Cenukki|Totyq Cenukkiq]] was compared to that of the divine siblings, which also had legal ramifications; in law, the [[Tot#Tot Cenukki|Totyq Cenukkiq]] were now legally considered siblings. It became increasingly common to worship the divine siblings ([[Moferrumca Xal|Moferrumyq Xalyq]]) at the same time. Their relationship, the divine siblinghood ([[Moferrumca Xal]]) was considered the ideal state of a being. *Moferrumca*, the concept of siblinghood, was thought to apply to all relationships, not just those between biological or adopted siblings.

The new religious doctrines quickly became popular for several reasons. [[Ran peoples|Ran]] culture already placed great value on family and close relationships, which made it easy to adopt. It was also useful politically, as the emphasis on siblinghood of the tutelary deities of [[Taspi]] and [[Kypky]] was thought to strengthen their union.
