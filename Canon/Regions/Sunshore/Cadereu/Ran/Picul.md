Picul (*late Totky*: [pit͡sul]) was a demonic figure in the folklore of [[Totky]]. It was based on [[Fecul]], a deity widely worshipped around Pilam, including in [[Taspi]].

 After failure of the [[Totky#Feculky uprising|Feculky uprising]] led by [[tot|totyq]] of Fecul, the cult of Fecul was suppressed, first in [[Feculky]] (renamed to [[Kyxal]]) and then in the rest of the areas under Totky influence. The aim was to combat the rebellious underground movement associated with him, which sought to restore the independence of Feculky. After the near-disappearance of the native Fecul cult in Taspi, the name was reloaned as Picul, reflecting vowel changes occurring in Totky at this time and the Kyxal [[Rantag#Dialectal variation|realization]] of /f/ as [ɸ]. Influenced by common portrayals of the covert movement as seditious and immoral, this time the name described a vengeful, cruel, and demonic figure said to be worshipped by the adherents. From there, the name spread widely around the sea.
 
 Later on, the use of Picul to refer to a specific demonic figure waned. One finds common descriptions of despised people like certain military leaders as being Picul, probably originally in a metaphorical sense. Later on, picul (plural piculyq) would denote a class of demonic beings, led by a king known simply as Picul or for the sake of differentiation Picultir ("Picul-king").
