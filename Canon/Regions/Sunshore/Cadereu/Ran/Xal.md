*xal* /x…ël/ was a [[Rantag]] word that was the closest equivalent to the English word "holy". However, the word had a wider range of meanings. Inititially, the word meant "set apart".
## Etymology

*xal* was from the archaic Rantag verb *xaly*, which meant "to separate", "to set apart". This verb corresponded to the standard (Totky) Rantag *xaloty* with the same meaning, formed from the former using the suffix -ot, originally a frequentative ending. While *xaly* was rarely if ever used in standard Rantag, *xal* remained a common word with a specialized sense, distinct from the derivatives of *xaloty*.

#### Early Ran practice

The original meaning of *xal* is best understood by ancient Ran ritual practices. When eating, drinking, or more generally benefitting from something, it was common to set apart a part of it as a gift to a god. For example, a family eating bread might have separated a piece with the intent to later deliver the piece to the sea as a gift to Pilur. Gifts like these were thought to please the gods and bring prosperity. 

Such a piece of bread, after being separated, would've been considered xal, "set apart". Even before the delivery of the piece, restrictions would have applied to the behaviour that could be shown towards it. For example, holding it with dirty hands or damaging it would've been against cultural mores. Eating the piece would have been scandalous, probably leading to harsh punishment of some sort.

It is possible that the prohibition originated from not wishing to make displeasing what was to be later given to the gods. Later on, in any case, the ownership of a xal thing was considered to already transfer to the gods the moment it was set apart, even when it was not physically given to them yet. From such a perspective, the prohibitions were rules against damaging the property of gods. Though it is unlikely this view was the original, requiring rather developed views of property, the invention must've still been early, being common in sources of the times.
