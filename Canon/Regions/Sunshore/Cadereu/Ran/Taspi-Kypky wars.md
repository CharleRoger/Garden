## Conquest of Kypky
In late 34 AGS, during the reign of a king known as [[Laxo]], [[Taspi]] launched an amphibious assault on [[Kypky]]. While the fight was initially going in [[Kypky|Kypky's]] favour, [[Taspi|Taspi’s]] troops managed to land on a large beachhead, and began raids on the city.

The conflict quickly turned in [[Taspi|Taspi’s]] favour, and the king of [[Kypky]] surrendered. His son was placed on the throne as a viceroy, with the kings of [[Taspi]] ruling the region through him. Additionally, he agreed to marry the daughter of the king, strengthening this political union. The terms of the surrender also put the [[tot]] of [[Kypky]] was put under the authority of the [[tot]] of [[Taspi]], who embarked in a religious reform in [[Kypky]], wishing to centralize the system to gain more power.
## Coup of 74 AGS
Although [[Taspi]] had initially been a monarchy, the power of the kings had waned significantly over the years. In the modern system, due to the influence of the [[Tot#Tot Cenukki|Tot Cenukki]], the king de facto had to follow his will on certain matters. However, the king still held military power, which the [[Tot#Tot Cenukki|Tot Cenukki]] did not possess. The situation commonly lead to conflicts between the two positions. During a heated power struggle in 74 AGS, the reigning king, [[Melna]], decided to act to seize power. He led the military into the capital, occupying the city. The [[Tot#Tot Cenukki|Tot Cenukki]] was arrested, but not killed due to political reasons. Various other political opponents of the king were also arrested or executed. This led to rioting, which was put down by force. As the chaos calmed, it seemed like [[Melna]] had succeeded in establishing himself as the supreme authority in [[Taspi]].
## Counter-coup of 75 AGS
The chaotic situation presented a political opportunity for [[Laxo]], the viceroy of [[Kypky]], who also happened to be the cousin of the king. He was supported by the [[tot]] of [[Kypky]], who was at the time called a [[Tot#tot cenuk|tot cenuk]], a "high tot" superior to the other [[tot|totyq]] in [[Kypky]] but still subordinate to the [[Tot#Tot Cenukki|Tot Cenukki]]. Together, the two figures raised an army in [[Kypky]], and sailed to [[Taspi]], launching an invasion of the city, with the pretence of establishing order and restoring the [[Tot#Tot Cenukki|Tot Cenukki]].

The battle for control of the city was chaotic. The army of [[Kypky]] made a successful landing outside the borders of the city, but was repelled from entering it. As the conflict ground to a halt, a long period of stalemate began. Religious elements within the city supported the invaders and helped them by sabotaging the army of [[Taspi]]. However, the defence stood.

Bodyguards were not allowed inside temples, as they were considered sacred places. When [[Melna]] was performing sacrifices in a central temple, an angry religious mob ambushed him and began beating him with their bare hands. The bodyguards violated the code to save the king but were too late. When the king succumbed to his injuries later that day, waves of chaos rolled over the people. Inspired by the assassination, new riots were launched all around the city, weakening the army's control. The military organization broke down due to a messy power struggle, allowing the forces of [[Kypky]] to make progress for the first time in weeks. As the invaders approached the city, many defected to their side, further sealing the city's fate.

The invasion had ended in a success for the viceroy and [[Tot#tot cenuk|tot cenuk]] of [[Kypky]].
