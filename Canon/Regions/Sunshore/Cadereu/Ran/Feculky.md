#### Uprising
*See: [[Totky#Feculky uprising]]*


#### Transition to [[Kyxal]]
The failure of the uprising meant the end of the old Feculky. The city, which had been greatly damaged during the siege, only suffered further destruction under the occupation by Totky and its allies. The cult of Fecul was violently suppressed, with shrines and temples burnt down. The fires spread to nearby quarters, and the smoke could be seen for miles. Totyq of Fecul fled, hid, or were killed. With the suppression of the cult, the old name of the city had to go too; in its place, [[Kyxal]], from *ky* "city-state" + *xal* "sacred", was instated by the occupiers.

It should be noted that *[[xal]]*, literally meaning "set apart", had a larger span of meanings than the English word "sacred". In that range were both "holy" and "sacred", but also "cursed". As such, the name was not merely positive.
