# History
## Monarchy
From the founding date of the city c. 100 BGS until 86 AGS, kings ruled over Taspi. The monarchy was an elective one; the king's council was able to pick any person to be the next king. However, in practice, only close male relatives of the dead kings were ever chosen. The king's powers were diverse, but not absolute, and he had to listen to the advice of his council before giving orders. During times of war, the king's powers were increased, but during peacetime, they returned back to what they had been. The king was de jure allowed to replace council members, although de facto this only happened very rarely, and with support from the rest of the council.

The king's council was initially relatively minor, only comprising a handful of individuals. As Taspi and its sphere of influence grew, the council grew with it. The king was now less able to govern directly and had to rely on the council members to exercise his power. Over time, the position of [[Tot#Tot Cenukki|Tok Cenukki]] became a very influential one. Tot was the name for a priest of a certain tribe or a settlement, and like most others, Taspi also had one, the [[tot]] of Taspi even being a member of the king's council. As Taspi grew, its tot began to hold power over the tots of the neighboring cities, which gave it the title of [[Tot#Tot Cenukki|Tok Cenukki]] "Highest Priest". As the highest religious authority in Taspi, the [[Tot#Tot Cenukki|Tok Cenukki]] had control over the religious lives of the other council members, and thus, a lot of prestige and influence. This led to the position of [[Tot#Tot Cenukki|Tok Cenukki]] eventually becoming a "power behind the throne".

## Taspi-Kypky war
In 34 AGS, the Kingdom of Taspi began a military assault on the city-state of [[Kypky]], beginning the [[Taspi-Kypky wars]], culminating in the formation of [[Totky]].
