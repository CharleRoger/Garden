# History
Not much is known about the origins of the Ran people. By 300 BGS, many settlements had formed on the coast of the sea. These slowly grew and coalesced, becoming city-states. Many of these city-states were led by kings. Priests, called [[tot|totyq]], ruled religious affairs and had a role in administering the state. In many city-states, certain [[tot|totyq]] came to wield political influence. [[Taspi]], founded in 100 BGS, eventually came to dominate the other city-states due to its strategic location and unified them under its rule.
# Language
The language of the Ran people was known as [[Rantag]]. Different settlements had their own dialects, which diverged over time.
# Religion
*See also: [[Ran polytheism]]*
In the Ran culture, high importance was placed on religion. The Ran shared a pantheon of gods, but different interpretations of these gods were common. The importance and hierarchy of the gods varied by tribe and region. When settlements became more prevalent, it became common for them to have their own "patron" deity, which would be the primary subject of worship.

All of the Ran deities had one thing in common; they were not human, or even humanoid. Instead, Ran deities were portrayed as human-sized crabs. It is not fully known why this was the case, but some hints may lie in popular cultural practices. The Ran considered crabs—a common animal in the region, and an important livelihood—holy, which is why numerous rituals were associated with them. The Ran also believed in a system of reincarnation. Everything was subject to reincarnation—not only living creatures, but also objects, plants, streams, settlements, and even dynasties. Things were able to reincarnate as very distinct things from what they had been. For example, a dead stream might reincarnate as feline animal, or an extraordinary person might reincarnate as a crab. Depictions of famous figures as crabs were not unusual, sometimes being made even though the subject was still alive.

Both [[Taspi]] and [[Kypky]] had their own patron deities. The patron deity of [[Taspi]] was [[Pilur]], the god of the sea, death, and sailors. In [[Kypky]], the patron deity was the eponymous [[Kyp]], the deity of the moons, fertility, and love. Unlike [[Pilur]], [[Kyp]] was female. In the larger [[Ran peoples#Religion|Ran pantheon]], these deities were thought to be a brother and a sister.

In both [[Taspi]] and [[Kypky]], the [[tot]] of the capital held power over the tots of the other cities. In this regard, [[Taspi]] was more centralized. After [[Kypky]] was annexed by [[Taspi]] in the [[Taspi-Kypky wars]], the [[tot]] of [[Kypky]] was subjugated to the [[tot]] of [[Taspi]], who was by now also known as the [[Tot#Tot Cenukki|Tot Cenukki]]. The [[Tot#Tot Cenukki|Tot Cenukki's]] reforms brought more centralization into the practice of religion in [[Kypky]]. For example, all [[tot|totyq]] in [[Kypky]] were now subjugated to both the [[tot]] of [[Kypky]] and the [[Tot#Tot Cenukki|Tot Cenukki]]. However, although he now held power over him, the [[Tot#Tot Cenukki|Tot Cenukki]] let the [[tot]] of [[Kypky]] stay relatively autonomous due to the difference in patron deities between the two regions. He proclaimed the [[tot]] of [[Kypky]] a [[tot]] of [[Pilur]], and more importantly, the [[Tot#Tot Cenuk|Tot Cenuk]] of [[Kyp]] — the title literally meaning ”High Priest”, whereas [[Tot#Tot Cenukki|Tot Cenukki]] meant ”The Highest Priest”. The [[Tot#Tot Cenukki|Tot Cenukki]] styled himself as the [[Tot#Tot Cenukki|Tot Cenukki]] of both [[Pilur]] and [[Kyp]].

With states rising to prominence, the practice of religion also changed. Polytheism gave way to henotheism and ditheism in Totky. For more info, see [[Ran polytheism]].
