### Phonotactics

The syllable structure was CVC. Loanwords from non-Ran languages typically dealt with this restriction by epenthetic vowels (usually y, though sometimes another one, like a next to ʁ).
### Allophony

### Dialectal ariation
## Grammar

The plural suffix was -q. As with other suffixes, an epenthetic -y- was used when phonotactically necessary.
