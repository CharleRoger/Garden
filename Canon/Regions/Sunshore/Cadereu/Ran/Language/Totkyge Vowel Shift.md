The Totkyge Vowel Shift (TVS) was a vowel shift that took place in Totky roughly between the first century BGS and third century AGS. The shift dramatically altered the pronunciations of most vowels of [[Rantag]] and marks the beginning of late Rantag. Due to the prestige associated with the speech of Totky and its political hegemony, the shift influenced nearly the entire Pilam region, especially the formal register known as *Tottag*. Later, it would characterize the speech of the Totkywa cultural region.

# Background

## Initial state

The oldest form of Rantag reconstructed had a cardinal three-vowel system, with vowel length being phonemic. This system was stable for a long time, albeit with emerging allophony.

## Western centering

Especially along the western coast of Pilam, shorter vowels attained increasingly centered positions. This was described by eastern commentators, like those from [[Feculky]], as "slurring". Western centering was likely prevalent in all social strata. Due to their location, [[Taspi]] and [[Kypky]] were both affected by Western centering.

At this point it becomes relevant to mention the presence of vowel allophones before uvulars. While their exact qualities are unclear, they must have been lower than the usual variants. It seems likely this kind of allophony was common around the entire Pilam and not restricted to the Western part.

# Loss of vowel length

The loss of phonemic vowel length meant the previous distinction of quantity was now one of vowel quality. The allophones next to uvular sounds may have been an exception, with no distinction remaining. In any case, all descendant forms show a merger.

The loss of vowel length was prevalent in Kypky before becoming mainstream in Taspi, where it was associated with the rural south and with being uneducated. In Kypky it had no such connotation, being the default pronunciation of even the upper class. The turning point could have have been the [[Taspi-Kypky wars#Counter-coup of 75 AGS|counter-coup of 75 AGS]], as a result of which Taspi got both a King and a Tot Cenukki from Kypky, both probably exhibiting the shift. Regardless, by the first half of second century, it was the main pronunciation everywhere in Totky, as evidenced by a contemporary manuscript from Serquky alleging that people from Taspi pronounced *sug* (guardian) as *syg* (fish). The pronunciations would have been /suːŋ/ and /suŋ/ in Serquky, yet /suŋ/ and /sʊŋ/ in Totky.

Note the raised /ʌ/ in the previous graph. This common feature among the upper class of Taspi would probably act as the trigger for the anticlockwise shift that was to follow.

# Anticlockwise vowel shift

By the late second century AGS, /ʌ/ would be further raised to /ɤ/, except when blocked by uvulars and merging with /ɐ/ - due to the ongoing merger of the uvulars and the velars, this led to inconsistent results. The shift was initially the most prevalent among upper-class totyq, with closer pronunciations viewed as more posh.

The raising to /ɤ/ seems to have pushed /ʊ/ towards /ʉ/. This would have then further pushed /ɪ/, causing it to merge with /e/, a former allophone that had now become phonemized due to the loss of uvulars. This anticlockwise shift became standard during the third century.

# Minor roundedness changes

The other vowel changes of the third century AGS were both related to the roundedness of vowels. These were the *syg* unrounding and the *qum*-*kom* merger. The first was the unrounding of the *syg* vowel /ʉ/, causing it to end up as /ɨ/. This change flew under the radar, mainly being attested in the speakers of other variants comparing the former to their /u/ and the latter to their /i/. The timing is unclear - some speakers may have had /ɨ/ even before the completion of the anticlockwise shift. The other change involved the vowel /ɤ/ being rounded and merging with /o/, which caused the words *qum* /kom/ and *kom* /kɤm/ to be pronounced alike as /kom/, well attested by contemporary sources.

# Spread and standardization

The political hegemony of Totky led to its pronunciations becoming viewed as prestigious. Its vowel inventory was utilized by upper-class people from the entire Ran cultural region, especially state officials, totyq, and the educated. With the local variants of Rantag drifting apart, Totky's speech acted as a lingua franca among the bureaucracy. Nonetheless, the local low variety was still retained at home and among the family, a form of diglossia. Due to its newfound role, the variant was increasingly codified towards the end of the third century, slowing down the rate of changes. The 'correct' pronunciations and grammar, taught in schools, became known as *Tottag*.
