Rantag /ʁɑntɑŋ/ was a language spoken by the [[Ran peoples]]. Over time, it increasingly diverged into different variants, which were generally still mutually intelligeble. This page focuses on the standard variant in Totky at the time of [[Totky#From monarchy to theocracy|its founding]], (note: this is cap, i don't know what happened here, ignore it) as that one would go on to have the most influence. However, notable variations are also described.
## Phonology
### Consonants

|             | Labial | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar   | Uvular   |
| ----------- | ------ | -------- | ------- | ------- | -------- |
| Stop        | p      | t        | c       | k       | q        |
| Fricative   | f      | s        |         | x       | ⟨r⟩  /ʁ/ |
| Nasal       | m      | n        |         | ⟨g⟩ /ŋ/ |          |
| Approximant | w      | l        |         |         |          |
### Vowels

|      | Front          | Back           |
| ---- | -------------- | -------------- |
| High | ⟨e, i⟩ /i, iː/ | ⟨y, u⟩ /u, uː/ |
| Low  |                | ⟨a, o⟩ /ɑ, ɑː/ |

(To avoid the use of diacritics,) The romanization for the vowels is based on later variant spoken in [[Totky]]. This variant had undergone a dramatic vowel shift, which included changes in the articulation of the short and the long vowels and the loss of a phonemic vowel length distinction.

|      | Front | Central | Back |
| ---- | ----- | ------- | ---- |
| High | i     | ⟨y⟩ [ɨ] | u    |
| Mid  | e     |         | o    |
| Low  |       | ⟨a⟩ [ɐ] |      |

### Phonotactics

The syllable structure was CVC. Loanwords from non-Ran languages typically dealt with this restriction by epenthetic vowels (usually /u/, though sometimes another one, like /ɑ/ next to ʁ).
### Allophony

x, ŋ, ɰ → ç, ɲ, j / _ i(:), i(: ) _ C, i(:) _ #
ʁ, l → χ, ɬ /_ [-voice], [-voice] _
f, s → v, z  / V _ V
### Dialectal variation

In [[Feculky]] and certain areas nearby, /f/ was typically pronounced as [ϕ]. It is likely that this is the older form, though [f] was nearly universal elsewhere. Speakers of variants with [f] sometimes imitated the Feculky [ϕ] using [p]. This is seen in loans like [[Picul]] (*late Totky*: [pit͡sul]), compare original Fecul (*early Totky*: [ficu:l], *Feculky*: [ϕicu:l]). Dialects with [ϕ] had [β] for the voiced intervocalic variant.

The pronunciation of /ʁ/ also depended on the region. [[Taspi]], [[Kypky]], and [[Feculky]] all had [ʁ], but notable settlements in the north-east used trilled [r] or sometimes flapped [ɾ]. Over time, ʁ won out due to the cultural influence of [[Totky]].

## Grammar

The plural suffix was -q. As with other suffixes, an epenthetic -y- (*early*: /u/) was used when phonotactically necessary. The exception to this was [[Serquky]], where the vowel used was -e- (*early*: /i/). -ca was used for forming abstract nouns as well as some collective phrases.
## Vocabulary

### Individual example

The words for father and mother were *icat* /i:cɑt/ and *inan* /i:nɑn/. These featured a fossilized i-, originally from the honorific *exe* [içi]. They were based on the older, archaic forms *tatta* and namma. The change from t to c is irregular; it is theorized to have happened due to the influence of neighbouring ç in the intermediate form [içtan]. The same change is seen in the [[Serquky]] *icir*, a form of address to the king, from *tir*.
