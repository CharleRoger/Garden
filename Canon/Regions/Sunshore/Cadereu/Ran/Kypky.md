# Name
*Kypky* translates to ”The city-state of [[Kyp]]”, named after the patron deity of this state, who is the deity of the moons, fertility, and love. Like most [[Ran peoples|Ran]] city-states, religion was highly valued, and the [[tot]] of this city held a lot of power.

# History
Since its beginning, Kypky served as an important center for maritime trade. Although it was smaller than [[Taspi]], it was in fact older, having been founded over a century earlier in the [[1st century BGS]]. Kypky’s smaller size was due to its chaotic internal politics, which kept its army and leadership constantly occupied.

## Taspi-Kypky war
In 34 AGS, the Kingdom of Taspi began a military assault on the city-state of [[Kypky]], beginning the [[Taspi-Kypky wars]], culminating in the formation of [[Totky]].
