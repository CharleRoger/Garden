The **Dugrien** were a group of peoples inhabiting eastern [[Cādereu]] in the [[1st millennium]]. Their history is recorded in scant inscriptions in the [[Psákaripsu]] language as well as some mentions in the histories of other civilisations of [[Cādereu]].
# History
## Formative period
- 23: Clans are formed, though there aren't many conflicts, only some small competitions.
- 39: A clear distinction between weak and strong clans begins. Strong clans own farms and animals, thus, having more things to trade. Small clans mostly live close to strong clans' villages depending on their food.
- 141: Weak clans get tired of being subordinates, so they start migrating to the south, aiming independence, a new life, a chance to become a strong clan and a climate warmer. They clash with a people known as [[Aripsin]] ("south-people") who begin raiding both strong and weak clans, so they fight together against the [[Aripsin]] and defeat them, killing all of them. [[Įkėrh]] of house [[Ekrebn]], a brave warrior who later became a leader and after his death in battle a legend, fought in the war with the [[Aripsin]].
- 176: [[Ehhetla]], the last speaker of the [[Aripsin]] language, dies of an unknown disease.

## War period
- 379: Small clans lived around big clans and eventually formed city states, where big clans had all the power. City states begin to conquer nearby clans in order to show power, forming small states.
- 442: Southern states begin to tax western tribes.
- 484: Western tribes begin to unite, forming small kingdoms.
- 592: A war starts between the states due to the murder of [[Hengira]] daughter of [[Psisōt]], one of the most powerful Dugrien kings.
- 605: The war ends. Dugrien states are divided in two commonwealths: The [[Free Kingdoms of the North]] and the [[Southern Commonwealth]]. A peace period begins, which would remain for more than two centuries.

## Peace period
- 744: A captain called [[Bįsōt Gukran]] sails to the east, trying to find new land. He manages to find [[Cqa|floating islands]], but nobody believes him, and he dies as a crazy man.

## Chaotic period
- 868: The [[Southern Commonwealth]] begins to conquer western tribes aiming to reach the west coast so they could make their business with the [[Loxezō]] easier.
- 870: Some of the [[Free Kingdoms of the North]] start wondering if this was a good opportunity to conquer fertile southern land, but some believe the southern people are their "brothers" and shouldn't be attacked. All this disorder begins a civil war, not only because of the southern people, but because some saw this disorder as a chance to get power.
- 872: A nomad from [[Ilsōnneu]] spreads the sayings of a "Goddess of life" and gains popularity, but he had anti-war ideas, so the lords who used the war to achieve power kill him.
- 879: The [[Southern Commonwealth]] conquers part of the west coast, ending the war.
- 882: Peace is eventually attained between the [[Free Kingdoms of the North|north]] and [[Southern Commonwealth|south]].
