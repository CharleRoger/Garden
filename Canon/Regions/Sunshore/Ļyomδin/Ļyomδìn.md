**Ļyomδìn** \[ɮ̱ʲomð̞ʶɪ̃] Ļyomδìn is a region of shrublands, mallee forests, and flood plains, fed by a shallow river that creates streams just as often as it absorbs them. It sits on a bed of sand and ash (red to the west, yellow to the east), which sits on a bed of grey sand and silt, which sits on a bed of many layers of sandstone. The sandstone rises out of the ground to form elaborate cliffs and caves, easily shaped by a purposeful hand. The dry season is sweltering, with occasional brush fires, and the river drying up to a trickle, and the lakes and streams to nothing. The wet season brings erratic rainfall, reviving the streams, creating shallow lakes here and there, and frequently causing the river to flood, which then traces fractals as it recedes over the next several days. The map is given for the wet season, with the lakes and streams, but not the floods. The total area of Ļyomδìn is 197,000 km², or about ⅕ of an Egypt. (Or, uncoincidentally, the exact size of the Murray Darling Depression in Australia.) The flora of Ļyomδìn are primarily comprised of many flowering shrubs, and a few trees, such as eucalyptus trees (which grow in forests of their characteristic trunk bundles or "mallees", reaching barely head height for André the Giant), black box trees, and red gum trees. Arthropods include ubiquitous sand mites, mosquitos, a large variety of ants (including rainbow ants, carpenter ants, several species with honeydew ants, and the giant ants farmed by the Ļyota), and honeybees that feed on the nectar of the _Banksia_ bushes. For vertebrates: fishes include the tiny fishes that populate the stream, and in the wetter parts of the year, elongated flatfishes, such as tonguefish. Reptiles include many skinks, several mound-builders (such as malleefowl and bushturkeys), a variety of honeyeaters, and sporadic populations of ostriches and emus. Mammals include bats, mice, rats, echidnas, talking wombats, macropods, dingos, rabbits, and red foxes.
