**Chitan** are a semi-sentient species of modular rock-like beings with connective tissue made out of lichens that were manually or overgrew over a boulder of rocks. Assuming any form, even humanoid, the Chitan are inhabitants of the most inhospitable areas of [[Khey desert]], or depths of flooded caves.
Known for building megalithic structures in the desert, these are well aligned with many astronomical events. Artificial mounds, pyramids and walls are also built by the Chitan, the function of these are yet to be known, for instance some have speculated the Chitan have extensive knowledge of astronomical and meteorological phenomena. But also some speculate the religious implications of such structures or practical reasons. 
Chitan are known for their modular nature and carvings in their body to which could be compared to tattoos in humans, maybe indicating an hierarchy, culture or religious reasons.
