The **Crawe** are a fictional species of corvid or corvid-like sophont found on [[Winter]]. They resemble earth's Common Raven in stature, having a length range of 50cm-70cm, a height range of 30cm-60cm, and a wingspan range of 115cm-150cm. They have a lifespan of 60-80 Winter years. Craw feathers are on average black, iridescent and glossy, however across different cultures they can range from having browner tones, differences in gloss, and sometimes even certain feather groups being white or leaning blue. Compared to other corvids, the Crawe have increased binocular vision around where tools are held in their beaks.

The [[Hàfê̦]] are an example of a Crawe culture.

The Crawe are capable of speech. The Crawe-IPA table is built upon the works of and heavily inspired by f0rm0r's C’ą̂ą́r & PastTheStarryVoids' Keedian. It is written from the perspective of humans analysing & mimicking Crawe speech. Like humans, the Crawe are capable of more sounds outside of the ones present in the table but those sounds are not attested for linguistical communication or are impossible for a human to recognize and note down.

Consonants are also capable of being Aspirated, Ejectives, and Implosives. The Crawe are also capable of producing a series of click-like consonants

*Technically, frontness and backness of vowels is controlled by beak openess, and openess of vowels is controlled by tongue fronting and backing*

The Crawe feature no vowel rounding in their own languages, but are capable of mimicing the vowel quality. Crawe vowels are by default creaky, but can be pronounced without creak. Both creaky and non-creaky vowels can be pronounced nasally. The Crawe are capable of complex tonality.

# Presophontic Crawe Behaviour
As the Crawe have become Sophonts, their behaviour is ultimately more defined by their culture and technology than their presophontic instincts. However, that does not mean these went away or that these do not impact how the modern Crawe behave.

## Nesting and Family
It can be hypothesized that the Presophontic Crawe were a species of bird that practiced cooperative breeding in rookeries, as the hallmarks of these strategies have made their impact on multiple Crawe cultures, the Hafe included.

The Terran Wikipedia defines Cooperative Breeding as "...a social system characterized by alloparental care: offspring receive care not only from their parents, but also from additional group members, often called helpers." It seemed the Presophontic Crawe favoured previous season's offspring as their Helpers.

Rookeries are defined by the Terran Wikipedia as "...a colony of breeding rooks, and more broadly a colony of several types of breeding animals...". They are named after the Terran Rook, which form multiple nests in colonies in treetops.

In fact, it can even be hypothesized that these Colonial Nesting behaviours may have been the fuse through which sophonthood spread through the Crawe.

There is some evidence that Colonial Nesting and forming Rookeries may be unnatural to the Crawe, and instead reflect behavioural adaption towards environmental pressures that allowed them to become sophonts - this evidence takes the form of 'micro-territories'; the Crawe being protective of their homes, having disputes with their neighbours, and having to overcome some inner desire for large territories that would be difficult with their more metropolitan sophont strategies they hold today. This may even explain the sometimes seen phenomenon of Hermeticism in certain Crawe, where a mated pair abandon their home settlement in favour of forming a more traditional Corvid territory.

The Crawe consistently demonstrate the ability and desire to keep in touch with family. Offspring that have left the nest will fly back to their parents every few years.
