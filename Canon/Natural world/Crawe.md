The **Crawe** are a fictional species of corvid or corvid-like sophont found on [[Winter]]. They resemble earth's Common Raven in stature, having a length range of 50cm-70cm, a height range of 30cm-60cm, and a wingspan range of 115cm-150cm. They have a lifespan of 60-80 Winter years Craw feathers are on average black, iridescent and glossy, however across different cultures they can range from having browner tones, differences in gloss, and sometimes even certain feather groups being white or leaning blue. Compared to other corvids, the Crawe have increased binocular vision around where tools are held in their beaks.

The [[Hàfê̦]] are an example of a Crawe culture.

The Crawe are capable of speech. The Crawe-IPA table is built upon the works of and heavily inspired by f0rm0r's C’ą̂ą́r & PastTheStarryVoids' Keedian. It is written from the perspective of humans analysing & mimicking Crawe speech. Like humans, the Crawe are capable of more sounds outside of the ones present in the table but those sounds are not attested for linguistical communication or are impossible for a human to recognize and note down.

*Technically, frontness and backness of vowels is controlled by beak openess, and openess of vowels is controlled by tongue fronting and backing*

The Crawe feature no vowel rounding in their own languages, but are capable of mimicing the vowel quality. Crawe vowels are by default creaky, but can be pronounced without creak. Both creaky and non-creaky vowels can be pronounced nasally. The Crawe are capable of complex tonality.
