**Plink** is a solid material with an unusually low density found in some places on [[Winter]], particularly the floating islands of [[Cqa]]. It appears to be a naturally-occurring mineral of a pale colour which can be pinkish or yellowish, though the origin of the material is not known, having been suggested to be a remnant of some planet-wide living structure or an unknown ancient technology.
# Name
_Plink_ is a translation of the common [[Möxali]] name for the material *tintin*, onomatopoeia for the sound of a ceramic cup or metal utensil bouncing around when dropped, since plink itself makes a similar sound.
# Occurrence
Plink is most commonly found within the floating islands of [[Cqa]], which are believed to be primarily composed of a high-purity form of the substance in order to explain their atmospheric buoyancy.
# History
The existence of plink has been known to the [[Maicqa]], the inhabitants of [[Cqa]], for several millennia, though they generally avoided its harvest and use.

The [[Xiyeru]] ship-builder and navigator [[Hōyecă Tŭlihoeʼōikwă]] was the first person to extract plink in quantity, though the total amount he acquired throughout his years of travelling to [[Cqa]] likely amounted to less than his own body weight. Plink was 
# Physical properties
The density of plink varies substantially depending on the quantity of other mineral inclusions, though generally sits below 100kg/m³. Denser mixtures involving plink do exist, but do not have many of the characteristic properties of plink and are visibly heterogeneous. Plink can be categorised into three purity regimes based on the observed geological structure of the [[Cqa]] islands and its density compared to air (~1.3kg/m³):
- **Dense plink**
	- 95-99.5% purity, 10–100x air density.
	- Looks and feels like an amorphous mineral, with colour ranging from pink to yellow and brown.
	- Close to the surface of the islands and therefore easiest to harvest.
	- The lightest of the dense plink, around 13-20kg/m³, was the type most desired by [[Hōyecă Tŭlihoeʼōikwă|Hōyecă]].
- **Light plink**
	- 99.5-99.95% purity, 1–10x air density.
	- Deeper into the islands, very difficult to harvest without compromising the buoyancy of the island.
	- Not harvested by the [[Xiyeru]] until the [[13th century]].
	- Pale in colour, almost white, with a porous chalky appearance but a glassy texture.
- **Superlight plink**
	- >99.95% purity, less dense than air.
	- Not yet directly observed, but its existence is inferred by the fact that the [[Cqa]] islands must have an overall density lower than air, which has a density of about 0.7-1.3kg/m³ over [[Cqa|Cqa's]] altitude range, if plink is indeed the source of their buoyancy.

Plink has extraordinarily high compressive strength for its similarly unnatural density, but is a terrible building material due to its poor tensile strength and brittleness. In fact, plink can easily be pulled apart and crumbled into pieces by hand.
