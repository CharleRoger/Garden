Cisi Religion \[Old]

Cisi religion is somewhat different from any religion found in Kóty, it is not a continuation of the Upic religion, but features small similarity to it. 

Early System As of the first Cisi migrating to the Yiyac Xa (the name of the peninsula inhabited by Cisi people), they had an animistic religion, there were no gods but worshiping the nature, soon shamans/priests/elders that had power to communicate to the supernatural would have seen as important figures, stories about personification of forces of the nature were they are treated as Gods. 

Modern religion as of 200AGS After a long time developing the faith through recognising Gods, and how the laws of nature work, Cisi people come up with a polytheistic system. 

The Gods There are five gods, each one is meant to represent parts of the human body and Nature. 

Çÿc-Xui The head god, it represents the mind, the sky and paternal figure. It is the god creator of the sky and sun. 

Toco-Xui The left hand god, often related with the smaller moon, represents the mundane nature of humans, peace, violence, disease, and people pray to him in times of hunger, death and war. 

Rÿrÿ-Xui The right hand god, often related to the big moon, represents the aspects of nature, disasters, life, animals, rain and fertility. People pray to him in times of productivity, the dry season and when hunting is scarce. 

Apf-Xui The left foot god, related to the underworld, is the god that keeps the deceased ones safe from escaping into the outerworld, which is inhabited by demons. 

Oso-Xui The right foot got, related to rebirth and maintenance of the time, Oso is a god that is supposedly father of all other gods, they fear it as it was an authorial figure. 

Oral tradition Oral tradition is well known in Cisi religion, it is an aspect of it, many tales and myths were told orally by elders, the rituals were also passed down by the elders.

  

Cisi religion \[New iteration]

Had this idea for the Cisi religion that goes like this: There's a god of remembrance, ancestrality and memory and so. Alongside this god there are two other concepts, Motion and Inertia, sorta like Yin and Yang

  

Something like a deity which is the memory of everything. Everything which has ever been told or will be in one being. Like an unending stream of memories and words. Similar this would be memory and remembrance and ... the word vs forgetfulness, oblivion, destruction in a way. The forgotten like the dead, not as bad inherently, but as a fact of life. Dreams are sort of "look into the world of the dead" or the world of the forgotten, basically being the same. A form of divination, similar to how other cultures would describe necromancy (uhm divination, not reanimation) something like a strongly dualist religion, except that dualism usually puts a high emphasis on good vs evil, think Zoroastrianism or Manichaeism, yet there it is more like.. two facts of life

the divide between life, memory, motion, awake, words, vision/sight - death, forgetting, inertia, sleep, silence, dreams.
