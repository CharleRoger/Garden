## Cremation ritual, Roisoʼo
The Ansang have a collection of funerary rites referred to as *Roisoʼo*. The ritual is divided into three stages, which may take five to seven days to completion. 
### Prerequisites, Vimo
A dead adult Ansang is mourned by means of cremation, the ceremonies which take place before the body is cremated are comprised of ritualistically cleansing the body by a hired [[Mbɨŋɨrɨl]], a priest trained to chant hymns, cleanse and instruct the deceased's soul the correct path for the afterlife. 
### Mourning, Ndusu
After all the cleansing rituals are done, the body is displayed for three days. Family members mourn  by praying to the deceased, and while the body is displayed the hired Mbɨŋɨrɨl priest retires for the remainder of the ritual to a secluded place and meditates on behalf of the deceased. 
### Sacrifice, Tɨʼɨña
Finally on the sixth day, the body is then wrapped with cloth and transported over to a pyre, then the Mbɨŋɨrɨl priest reemerges from his meditative state and chants the last hymns.



For a proper send off, Ansang leaders.
