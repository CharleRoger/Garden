## Early Ran
Ran shared a pantheon of gods, but different interpretations of these gods were common. The importance and hierarchy of the gods varied by tribe and region. When settlements became more prevalent, it became common for them to have their own "patron" deity, which would be the primary subject of worship.

All of the Ran deities had one thing in common; they were not human, or even humanoid. Instead, Ran deities were portrayed as human-sized crabs. It is not fully known why this was the case, but some hints may lie in popular cultural practices. The Ran considered crabs—a common animal in the region, and an important livelihood—holy, which is why numerous rituals were associated with them.

Notable deities included:
[[Feculky]]
[[Kypky]]
[[Pilur]]
