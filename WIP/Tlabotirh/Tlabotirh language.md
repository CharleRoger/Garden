Phonotactics:

  

Syllable structure is CV(C). The last consonant of a syllable is always one of {n,ŋ,l,ɹ,ʁ}. The first consonant is never optional, not even in initial syllables. nk, nkʷ, ng, ngʷ, ŋŋʷ, nŋʷ, nŋ, ʁr, rʁ, ʁʁʷ and rʁʷ are not allowed sequences, and they simplify to ŋk, ŋkʷ, ŋ, ŋʷ, ŋʷ, ŋʷ, ŋ, r, ʁ, ʁʷ and ʁʷ respectively when they would otherwise occur. Geminates are also forbidden, and simplify to just a single consonant when they would normally occur.

  

Stress:

  

Stress is always word initial. In compound words, only the first syllable has stress.  
  
Allophony:

  

x,t,d,ŋ → ç,t͡s,d͡z,ɲ / _{i,e}

  

ʁ → ɣ / _{l,k,g,ŋ,kʷ,gʷ,ŋʷ}, {l,ŋ}_

ʁx → ɣ

  

n → m / _ {p, b, f, v}  
ŋ → ɲ / _{t,d,t͡ɬ,d͡ɮ}

  

VN → ṼN

  
  
  
  
  

Grammar

  

Tlabotirh has two genders: common and neuter. The genders of words are almost completely arbitrary, except the common gender is used when referring to humans. 

  

Tlabotirh has several cases with their own endings. The genitive case is only used with pronouns and demonstratives and fossilized in certain sayings. For other words, the particle ki is used.

  

The cases are: nominal, (genitive), accusative, locative, ablative and lative

  

Word order is usually SOV. However, to emphasize a word or a phrase, it can be put into the first spot in the sentence. Adverbs are usually placed at the end of the sentence or before a verb.

Changes in daughter langs:

  
  

Hlavsee:

ʁ and ʁʷ become χ and χʷ

note: ”x -> ç / _{i,e}”, which is already allophonic, becomes phonemic after after the next step

χ and χʷ -> x and xʷ

kʷ, gʷ and ŋʷ merge into p, b and m

xʷ -> w

x and f->h

b becomes v intervocalically 

syncope

s in coda->h

r and h disappear in the coda but cause compensary lengthening in the previous vowel

affricates merge with continuants (including the allophones of t and d (now actually phonemic because of syncope))

  

Tlabude:  
  
Labiodorsal sounds merge into the regular dorsal sounds.  
Syllable final ɹ and ʁ are lost (however they previously influenced the vowels)  
chain shift o->u->y
