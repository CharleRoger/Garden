# Proto-Koyanic
[[Proto-Koyanic language|Proto-Koyanic]] has a couple of derivational verb suffixes which indicate something to do with motion or manner, e.g. \*px₃ə́t "step" > \*px₃ə́tkīr̥h "walk", where \*-kīr̥h suggests oscillating or ambulatory motion. These suffixes are a closed class; there was no mechanism for introducing new suffixes like this in Proto-Koyanic.

First posit of a nominal form of the verb similar to Latin's first supine, difficult to reconstruct the exact derivation but only appearing in the dative, representing some even older pattern which decayed to this single use.
>`qʰw̥ə̄́x₃m̥h-?-x₂əl̥  ŋə̄́q -x₁əʡ`
>`travel  -?-DAT   walk-IND.1SG`
>"I walk in order to travel"
# Proto-Gäj
[[Proto-Gäj]] continues the Proto-Koyanic feature of allowing postpositions on only the dative and ablative, but as the isolated dative starts to take the role of the accusative, postpositions become necessary for any other role. This includes this supine-like verb form, which broadens its meaning from purpose to circumstance, requiring a postposition.
>`xwōmax    θōm      ŋāk -a`
>`travel.?  towards  walk-IND.1SG`
>Literally "I walk towards travel", meaning "I walk in order to travel" or "I walk to somewhere with the purpose/intention of travelling"

Later in Proto-Gäj, auxiliary-verb based syntax becomes widespread in many parts of the grammar. The supine-like construction survives through an auxiliary construction with the verb \*-hā- "make, do", from PKn \*hx₃ə̄́ "create".
Additionally, the postpositions become cliticised, triggering a semi-regular loss of the final \*-x.
>`xwōma   -θom      (na)-hā  -a`
>`travel.?-towards  (..)-make-IND.1SG`
>Literally "I make towards travel", meaning "I travel towards"
# Proto-Namb
The verb prefix is a weakly attached and optional part of the verb structure in [[Proto-Namb language|Proto-Namb]], so is frequently left off when context permits. This results in the contraction of the phrase into a single indicative verb with the underlying stem vowel -a-. The loss of the supine-like's \*-a, completely erasing any trace of the original derivation from the bare verb stem, is irregular, but whatever.
>`xum   -fom    -o`
>`travel-towards-IND.1SG`
>"I travel towards"

Old suffixes like \*-kīr̥h > \*-cix, if they are not completely obscured by sound change, fit into the new system of motive suffixes. There are ~20 of these suffixes, listed below.
- **-cix** "oscillating, ambulating"
- **-ta** "properly, well, completely"
- **-fom** "towards"
- **-ib** "(all the way) to, at"
- **-tu** "throughout, all over, randomly, onto"
- "away from, before, differently"
- **-aŋg** "along, adhering to a particular direction"
- **-(e)br** "against, across, over itself, back on itself"
- "following, after, in the same way"
- "going into, inside, concurrently, together"
- "coming out of, outside, separately"
- **-ag** "bringing together, closing up, combining, gathering"
- "between, among, around, about"
- **-i** "upwards, forwards, progressing, for a purpose"
- "across, via, through, over"
- "under, improperly, going around, backwards"
- "all the way up to, nearly, barely"
- "frequentative"
- **-je** "repeated, attempting, correcting"
