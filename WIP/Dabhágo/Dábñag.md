### Tone

There are three tones: mid, high, and low: a á à
### Phonotactics

Syllable structure is CV(κ), where κ can be any nasal or a voiced stop.
Geminate consonants are allowed.
### Allophony

b, ɟ and g are pronounced v, ʝ and ɣ when between vowels
b, d, ɟ, and g are pronounced w, l, j and ɰ when in the syllable coda
- However, several dialects merge w and ɰ
s is pronounced as s before i, e and ε but as ɬ otherwise
- In several dialects, s is pronounced non-word initially as θ before i, e and ε
d when between two vowels and in the onset is pronounced as z before i, e and ε, but as ɮ otherwise
- In several dialects, d when between two vowels and in the onset is pronounced as ð before i, e and ε
x is pronounced as ç before i, e and ε, and between two different vowels it often isn’t pronounced at all. 
- In several dialects, x is also not pronounced word initially
consonant geminates b:, d:, ɟ: and g: are always pronounced as how they would be pronounced with the single consonants but as geminated.

The word order is SOV

Adjectives come after nouns. 

In questions, a question word such as “what” is used. You can add “te” to the end of any sentence to make it a yes or no question.

There are only two cases, nominative and genitive.

Certain prepositions use genitive but most use the nominative.

### Genitive

If the word ends in a vowel, the genitive is formed by adding a b to the end of a word. However, sometimes -pab is added instead. This in some contexts might make the vowel mutate. If the word ends in a nasal, the nasal is replaced with an m. If the word ends in a voiced stop that is not b, the stop is replaced with a b. However, sometimes, the vowel mutates as well. Lastly, if a word ends in b, -ab is added. 

edit2025: there was some kind of logic to this but i just can't remember. will try to figure out later
