Krobu was a coastal region in the north of Fountainhead, west from [[Khey desert]] and south from [[Kóty]]. Krobu was inhabited primarily by the [[Arklobu]] tribes, a Koyanic people generally speaking a [[Namb languages|Nambic language]], with a significant and oftentimes politically powerful minority speaking Ansang or having Ansang ancestry.

A lot can be understood about Krobu c. 1200 AGS just by viewing it macroscopically:

- There is no central rulership over Krobu
- Many small polities are engaged in constant conflict and diplomacy
- There is trade between the polities and they likely rely on their relationships with others
- The polities have some notion of territory which they consider valuable
- Members of the general populace, or the elite, or both, align themselves with one of a few tribes, so perhaps cultural identity and claims to power stem from perceived descent from an ancestral individual or group

  @junkshipp something I wanted to post about Krobu lore, which I already talked about with Charlie and Davi, but since Krobu was your creation first. my ideas are for the following historical periods: OKM (Old Krobu Maritime Culture) 6th century BGS - 2nd century AGS A maritime culture which spread metallurgy through Krobu. It flourishes through interregional trade networks and maybe guild-like structures and trade syndicates which form proto-states (though without territorial binding). Monopoly on metal trade among other things during its height. After the 2nd century BGS it begins to regionalize and transform into new cultures and polities. Preclassic Krobu 2nd century - 6th century The first proper states form, at least those in cultural memory and which have later successors. So like most dynasties and political systems can be traced back to this period. I imagine it like Classical Greece pre-Hellenism. A lot of poleis with their own diversity in culture and statecraft, basically you have monarchies, duarchies, republics and weird state forms in between. What you do not have is writing. A powerful clerical class controls religion. Classical Krobu 6th century - 10th century Through diffusion from trade, writing appears in Krobu, coming from the Telehe Empire. Some states adopt it wholly, while more conservative states adopt it only for bureaucracy and trade. A second disruption appears in the 820s in the form of Loshianism. Some polities convert to Loshianism, while in others the old religious class tries to suppress it. At the end of this period Krobu becomes part of an increasingly internationalizing trade network between the Lavondu and Ansang.

  History of the Ansang Empire:
  
  - Maŋembi (he needs a nickname... the Conqueror, the Cruel?)
    
    - Upon becoming King he begins to fully integrate those newly founded settlements, by force if necessary. Starts a long war campaign all around the Krobu islands. Conquers areas as far north as Senzeppo.

- There are meant to be many languages in krobu anyway, tbh if you just throw down a bunch of names that gives us something to go off for the languages there

**Kīrabbō** — Krobu, named for its ubiqutous melons (_kirab_) which are a central pillar of the society and economy. Ansangic dialects are also spoken on some islands here, but the culture is otherwise very much like the mainland. The Arklobu are the closest relatives of the Nambāno, a fact which is quite evident to anyone of either group who visits the other.
