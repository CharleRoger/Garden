Krobu was a coastal region in the north of Fountainhead, west from [[Khey desert|Khey]] and north from [[Kóty]]. Krobu was inhabited primarily by the [[Arklobota]], a Koyanic people mostly speaking a Nambic language known as [[Arklobu]], with minorities speaking other [[Namb languages]] or [[Ansang language|Ansang]]. Krobu, from Arklobu *kerab* (~ melon) + *u* (land), is named after a type of plant species commonly found there.

# History

## Northern Kóty Premetallic Complex (NKPM)
*1st millennium - 2nd century BGS*

The neolithic [[Northern-Koty Pre-Metallic Complex]] or **NKPM** existed for several centuries during the [[1st millennium BGS]], in an area of southern Krobu later known as [[Bezgon]]. Its cultural zenith is traditionally placed into the [[8th century BGS|8th]] and [[7th century BGS|7th]] centuries BGS, right before the widespread adoption of metallurgy. Indeed, the NKPM remained primarily characterised by its lack of metal tools even after this point. By the 5th century BGS, NKPM was in a state of decline: there was no transition between NKPM settlements and new settlements of the metallic [[Old Krobu Maritime Culture|OKM]], with the former simply given up. During the [[3rd century BGS|3rd]] and [[2nd century BGS]], the NKPM quickly collapsed, leading to migrations and the formation of the [[South-Koyanic Pastoralic Complex]], also called Proto-[[Hnäzb people|Hzäzb]]. Before this abandonment of settlements en masse, the people of the NKPM were sedentary pastoralists.
## Old Krobu Maritime Culture (OKM) 
*7th century BGS - 2nd century AGS*

The [[Old Krobu Maritime Culture]] or **OKM** was an early metallic culture. Vastly successful, it covered large parts of [[Krobu]], the northern reaches of [[Kóty]] and land as far north as [[Qnōp']], contributing to the spread of the ancestors of the [[Nambāno]] and [[Arklobu]] peoples and languages. Emerging from unclear origins, it contributed to the decline of and largely displaced the NPKM. At its height, OKM monopolized metal trade and flourished through interregional trade networks and syndicates. {It is at this point that some first see proto-states emerge, though without territorial binding.} Polities finally make their appearance during the terminal era from 2 BGS on, with OKM fragmenting and transforming into new cultures, setting the stage for Preclassic Krobu. Due to the lack of writing, many details remain unclear.

  {claim based on FloZone's: "It flourishes through interregional trade networks and maybe guild-like structures and trade syndicates which form proto-states (though without territorial binding)"}
### Early OKM
7th - 4th century BGS*

There are two competing theories of how the OKM began. The *Autochthonous Theory* states that the [[Koyanic languages|Koyanic]] ancestors of the OKM spread northward prior to the invention of metallurgy and reached Krobu before or around the start of the [[1st millennium BGS]]. These people may or may not have been part of the [[Northern-Koty Pre-Metallic Complex|NKPM culture]]. When metallurgy began to spread from Kóty during the [[8th century BGS|8th century]], they adopted it and brought about the OKM. The competing *Expansion Theory* states that the northern reach of [[Koyanic languages]] prior to the invention of metallurgy did not extend beyond [[Bezgon]] and was likely even more southerly. The invention of metallurgy caused several waves of expansion within central [[Kóty]], which kickstarted the migration of [[Koyanic peoples]] into all directions. With their new metal tools, the OKM ancestors would rapidly colonise Krobu.
### Mature OKM
*4th - 2nd century BGS*

The OKM reached its cultural zenith and largest expansion in this era, with several major centers in Krobu. OKM tools and artefacts can be found all over the region, reaching north as far as [[Qnōp'.]] Their southward reach is however more limited. They are found at the coastal regions of westernmost [[Kóty]], but do not reach into central Kóty or [[Ansang Islands|Ansang]]. At the same time as the OKM flourished, the [[Northern-Koty Pre-Metallic Complex|NKPM]] collapsed. Cause and effect has been suggested, as the former would have made the latter increasingly marginalized. {In several areas, archaeological evidence from this era shows both the foundation of new OKM settlements and the abandonment of NPKM ones occurring at the same time. There seems to be a lack of continuity and overlap, with communities clearly belonging to one of two types, in contrast to earlier eras.} Though rare, NKPM finds also {begin to} include metal tools, yet these are of OKM origin and acquired by trade.

It is unclear whether there was state-level organisation between different OKM sites during this time or whether villages and towns formed small independent units. However there was one cosmopolitan element in their society, which connected traders and artisans alike. Some people have theorised about guild like organizations, which dominated trade and formed cosmopolitan proto-states. 
### Terminal OKM
*2nd century BGS - 2nd century AGS*

Also known as the regionalisation period, the final stage of the OKM is regarded as a transition to the Preclassic period. While classical OKM artefacts remain in use, new artefacts and innovative technologies appear, among them the [[Yayamok type canoe]]. New artefacts are particularly regional and indicate the presence of states or at least individual polities. This is the earliest era [[Arklobu]] histories refer to, though a skeptical outlook is needed due to writing only reaching Krobu centuries later.
## Preclassic Krobu
*2nd century - 6th century*

{The first proper states form, at least those in cultural memory and which have later successors. So like most dynasties and political systems can be traced back to this period. I imagine it like Classical Greece pre-Hellenism. A lot of poleis with their own diversity in culture and statecraft, basically you have monarchies, duarchies, republics and weird state forms in between. What you do not have is writing. A powerful clerical class controls religion.}
## Classical Krobu
*6th century - 10th century*

{Through diffusion from trade, writing appears in Krobu, coming from the Telehe Empire. Some states adopt it wholly, while more conservative states adopt it only for bureaucracy and trade. A second disruption appears in the 820s in the form of Loshianism. Some polities convert to Loshianism, while in others the old religious class tries to suppress it. At the end of this period Krobu becomes part of an increasingly internationalizing trade network between the Lavondu and Ansang.}

## {Postclassic} Krobu
*10th century - {16th century}*

Davi: {In 1000AGS Berkke kingdom was mainly Loshianist, majority of Traditional people migrated outside the kingdom to build their own nation, a group of five hundred people including several priests and people who felt disgusted by Loshianism, they migrated into Qachkav land and even north into Krobu lands, from there many small states devoted to the old Berkke Gods established themselves.}

A trade boom in the early [[11th century]] bolstered the economy of [[T'ugü]] and other societies connected to the maritime trade network, including [[Qnōp']] and [[Krobu]]. 


# Culture

## Politics
[[Nambō]]
   In the earliest history of [[Nambō]], society was stratified into around five or six castes, inherited from the earlier [[Nambic peoples|Nambic]] culture of ancient [[Krobu]]. Later, in the period leading up to and following the [[Qnōp' rebellion]], a cultural belief that each stratum was considered a necessary pillar of civilisation developed, and the canonical number of strata universally settled on five:

1. [[Sakkorājā]] — Priests, lords and certain kinds of scholars.
2. [[Jakkuarasō]] — Soldiers and political officers.
3. [[Huitēglō]] — Scribes, natural philosophers, civic project managers and other skilled workers.
4. [[Ābrējō]] — Farmers, builders, couriers and other labourers.
5. [[Dēmōdō]] — Merchants, entertainers, artists and other craftspeople.
