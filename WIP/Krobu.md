Krobu was a coastal region in the north of Fountainhead, west from [[Khey desert|Khey]] and north from [[Kóty]]. Krobu was inhabited primarily by the [[Arklobota]], a Koyanic people mostly speaking a Nambic language known as [[Arklobu]], with minorities speaking other [[Namb languages]] or [[Ansang language|Ansang]]. Krobu, from Arklobu *kerab* (~ melon) + *u* (land), is named after a type of plant species commonly found there.

# History

## Northern Kóty Premetallic Complex (NKPM)

The neolithic [[Northern-Koty Pre-Metallic Complex]] or **NKPM** existed for several centuries during the [[1st millennium BGS]], in an area of southern Krobu later known as [[Bezgon]]. Its cultural zenith is traditionally placed into the [[8th century BGS|8th]] and [[7th century BGS|7th]] centuries BGS, right before the widespread adoption of metallurgy. Indeed, the NKPM remained primarily characterised by its lack of metal tools even after this point. By the 5th century BGS, NKPM was in a state of decline: there is no transition between NKPM settlements and new settlements of the metallic [[Old Krobu Maritime Culture|OKM]], with the former simply being given up. During the [[3rd century BGS|3rd]] and [[2nd century BGS]], the NKPM quickly collapsed, leading to migrations and the formation of the [[South-Koyanic Pastoralic Complex]], also called Proto-[[Hnäzb people|Hzäzb]]. Before this mass-abandonment of settlements, the people of the NKPM were sedentary pastoralists.
## Old Krobu Maritime Culture (OKM) 
*6th century BGS - 2nd century AGS*

The [[Old Krobu Maritime Culture]] or **OKM** was an early metallic culture. Vastly successful, it covered large parts of [[Krobu]], the northern reaches of [[Kóty]] and as far north as [[Qnōp']], contributing to the spread of the ancestors of the [[Nambāno]] and [[Arklobu]] peoples and languages. Emerging from unclear origins, it contributed to the decline of and largely displaced the NPKM. At its height, OKM monopolized metal trade and flourished through interregional trade networks and syndicates. {It is at this point that some first see proto-states emerge, though without territorial binding.} Polities finally make their appearance during the terminal era from 2 BGS on, with OKM fragmenting and transforming into new cultures, setting the stage for Preclassic Krobu. Due to the lack of writing, many details remain unclear.

{The first proper states form, at least those in cultural memory and which have later successors. So like most dynasties and political systems can be traced back to this period. I imagine it like Classical Greece pre-Hellenism. A lot of poleis with their own diversity in culture and statecraft, basically you have monarchies, duarchies, republics and weird state forms in between. What you do not have is writing. A powerful clerical class controls religion.}
## Classical Krobu
*6th century - 10th century*

{Through diffusion from trade, writing appears in Krobu, coming from the Telehe Empire. Some states adopt it wholly, while more conservative states adopt it only for bureaucracy and trade. A second disruption appears in the 820s in the form of Loshianism. Some polities convert to Loshianism, while in others the old religious class tries to suppress it. At the end of this period Krobu becomes part of an increasingly internationalizing trade network between the Lavondu and Ansang.}

Davi: {In 1000AGS Berkke kingdom was mainly Loshianist, majority of Traditional people migrated outside the kingdom to build their own nation, a group of five hundred people including several priests and people who felt disgusted by Loshianism, they migrated into Qachkav land and even north into Krobu lands, from there many small states devoted to the old Berkke Gods established themselves.}

A trade boom in the early [[11th century]] bolstered the economy of [[T'ugü]] and other societies connected to the maritime trade network, including [[Qnōp']] and [[Krobu]]. 


# Culture

## Politics
[[Nambō]]
   In the earliest history of [[Nambō]], society was stratified into around five or six castes, inherited from the earlier [[Nambic peoples|Nambic]] culture of ancient [[Krobu]]. Later, in the period leading up to and following the [[Qnōp' rebellion]], a cultural belief that each stratum was considered a necessary pillar of civilisation developed, and the canonical number of strata universally settled on five:

1. [[Sakkorājā]] — Priests, lords and certain kinds of scholars.
2. [[Jakkuarasō]] — Soldiers and political officers.
3. [[Huitēglō]] — Scribes, natural philosophers, civic project managers and other skilled workers.
4. [[Ābrējō]] — Farmers, builders, couriers and other labourers.
5. [[Dēmōdō]] — Merchants, entertainers, artists and other craftspeople.

### [[Old Arklobu]]

Old Arklobu** is a partly attested, partly reconstructed language and ancestor of the [[Arklobu language]] later spoken in [[Krobu]]. It is thought to have been spoken throughout essentially the entire [[1st millennium BGS]], largely before the first writing appeared in [[Krobu]].

### [[Nambō]]

There was no real cultural endonym for the people of Nambō considered as a whole, rather people were primarily thought of as belonging to distinct social classes. There was a similar class hierarchy in [[Krobu]], which like its language and people, was recognised contemporaneously as being closely related to that found in [[Nambō]]. These social categories were also broadly applied to more foreign cultures in order to have some foundation for international relations. For example, [[Hnäzb people|Hnäzb]] chiefs were considered similarly to *ōmōda*, Nambō lords, as governors of their respective regions of the [[Red steppe]] due to the strong connection between a [[Hnäzb people|Hnäzb]] tribe and its land, though their own perspective of land ownership was quite different.

### [[Loshianism]]

In 1000AGS Berkke kingdom was mainly Loshianist, majority of Traditional people migrated outside the kingdom to build their own nation, a group of five hundred people including several priests and people who felt disgusted by Loshianism, they migrated into Qachkav land and even north into Krobu lands, from there many small states devoted to the old Berkke Gods established themselves.
### [[Arklobu language]]

**Arklobu** is a [[Koyanic languages|Koyanic language]] which was the predominant language in [[Krobu]] during the [[Krobu classic period]].

[...]

The term *[[Arklobu dictionary#arklobu|arklobu]]*, however, referred not only to the language but also the speakers of the language and more broadly as a demonym for all inhabitants of [[Krobu]]. This latter sense was later supplanted by the collective noun *[[Arklobu peoples|arklobota]]*.

### [[Exploration of Cqa]]

The [[9th century]] saw the rise of the [[Lavondu]] culture, bearing a new generation of explorers, though mostly accidental, who nonetheless extended their knowledge of the world to include [[Qnōp']], [[Krobu]] and [[Ansang]]. In the [[10th century]], attention was turned again to [[Cqa]] when [[Lavondu]] trading ships returning from [[Udovuʼo]] began to stumble across the islands, leading communities of [[Lavondu]] explorers to organise deliberate missions to [[Cqa]], finding their first successes in the 920s.

### [[Ansang Empire]]

Upon the arrival of [[Lavondu]] settlers, Ansang Empire was introduced to the trade system and outside world of far northern Fountainhead, with the provided knowledge of [[Lavondu]] of writing [[Opsíbdañox]] , Ansang scholars and commoners made use of it, in an uncensored way, many writing variants flourished and vanished through time.

Sought to expand its borders and extraction of raw materials upon population growth, the Ansang empire settled under the command of Mboxuya in the regions of [[Qnōp']], [[Krobu]] and [[Koyan]]. Diplomacy campaigns with the proposal of establishing safe trading routes and protection from the empire seemed promising (almost like a feudal system) and it made both sides happy, [[Nambāno]] people agreed for a limited time.

[...]

The civil war plagued the reign of [[Xipi]] for the next eight years exhausting the economy with unfeasible costs, Xipi campaign against his brothers and the High Priests killed them all, but at last, other wealthy families conspired against Xipi, he was assassinated (963 AGS). Ending the long run Ansang Empire had, engulfed by wrath and despair one last High Priest [[Ndoyamba]] and his acolytes hidden from all fled towards the [[Krobu islands]] in hope of new beginnings.

A lot can be understood about Krobu c. 1200 AGS just by viewing it macroscopically:

- There is no central rulership over Krobu
- Many small polities are engaged in constant conflict and diplomacy
- There is trade between the polities and they likely rely on their relationships with others
- The polities have some notion of territory which they consider valuable
- Members of the general populace, or the elite, or both, align themselves with one of a few tribes, so perhaps cultural identity and claims to power stem from perceived descent from an ancestral individual or group

  @junkshipp something I wanted to post about Krobu lore, which I already talked about with Charlie and Davi, but since Krobu was your creation first. my ideas are for the following historical periods: OKM (Old Krobu Maritime Culture) 6th century BGS - 2nd century AGS A maritime culture which spread metallurgy through Krobu. It flourishes through interregional trade networks and maybe guild-like structures and trade syndicates which form proto-states (though without territorial binding). Monopoly on metal trade among other things during its height. After the 2nd century BGS it begins to regionalize and transform into new cultures and polities. Preclassic Krobu 2nd century - 6th century The first proper states form, at least those in cultural memory and which have later successors. So like most dynasties and political systems can be traced back to this period. I imagine it like Classical Greece pre-Hellenism. A lot of poleis with their own diversity in culture and statecraft, basically you have monarchies, duarchies, republics and weird state forms in between. What you do not have is writing. A powerful clerical class controls religion. Classical Krobu 6th century - 10th century Through diffusion from trade, writing appears in Krobu, coming from the Telehe Empire. Some states adopt it wholly, while more conservative states adopt it only for bureaucracy and trade. A second disruption appears in the 820s in the form of Loshianism. Some polities convert to Loshianism, while in others the old religious class tries to suppress it. At the end of this period Krobu becomes part of an increasingly internationalizing trade network between the Lavondu and Ansang.

  History of the Ansang Empire:
  
  - Maŋembi (he needs a nickname... the Conqueror, the Cruel?)
    
    - Upon becoming King he begins to fully integrate those newly founded settlements, by force if necessary. Starts a long war campaign all around the Krobu islands. Conquers areas as far north as Senzeppo.

- There are meant to be many languages in krobu anyway, tbh if you just throw down a bunch of names that gives us something to go off for the languages there

**Kīrabbō** — Krobu, named for its ubiqutous melons (_kirab_) which are a central pillar of the society and economy. Ansangic dialects are also spoken on some islands here, but the culture is otherwise very much like the mainland. The Arklobu are the closest relatives of the Nambāno, a fact which is quite evident to anyone of either group who visits the other.
