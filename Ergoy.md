Ergoy ([[Berkke language|Berkke]]: [erɡoɤ ~ erɡɤː], [[Ansang language|Ansang]]: [Erŋo]) was a Berkke religious figure who preached adherence to Losh, an ancient Berkke deity that had nonetheless become obscure. The cult of Losh was already henotheistic, but Ergoy took this further and asserted that Losh was the only true god. Ergoy's teachings formed the basis for [[Loshianism]], a monotheistic religion in [[Koty|Kóty]] that eventually became widespread.
