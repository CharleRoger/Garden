**Söwita̋néÿ** /sovitəːneːy/ (rock-speech) is the script used to write the [[Täne language]], usually etched into stone using metal chisels or fragments.

It was adapted into [[Reformed Haankaysiw Writing]] in the [[1st century]] AGS.
# Signs
The script is a syllabary with the following properties:
- Consonant voicing is not distinguished
- Harmonic pairs of vowels are not distinguished
- Generally written top-to-bottom, left-to-right, but can also be written horizontally left-to-right
- Vowel length is represented by writing a vowel sign after the main syllable
- Clusters and geminates are represented by echoing the vowel of the following syllable, e.g. /-t.te-/ is written ⟨TE-TE⟩

# Example
Below is a rune poem by an unknown [[Mÿrșo·to]] in 20 BGS, depicting the myth of the three Riders, who after saving the first [[Mÿrșo·to]] from the moon and splitting it in two, rode into the sky to keep a vigilant eye over the [[Mÿrșo·to]] for the rest of time. The little pictograms at the bottom are a representation of what the words mean, working as both a little artistic flourish and also helping to disambiguate the text.

A transcription and translation of the text follows.
