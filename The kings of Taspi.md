Many dates are estimates or educated guesses. Little information has been preserved about kings earlier than those in this list, and the first ones in the list seem to have legendary aspects anyways.

The role and power of the kings varied by time period. Originally the supreme political figure, the position of king was slowly overshadowed by the [[Tot#Tot Cenukki|Tot Cenukki]]. After a failed self-coup by Melna "the Wicked" to restore royal power, kingship passed to the [[Kypky]] branch, and the kings from Kyrna onwards would spend most of their time in [[Kypky]]. Instead, [[Taspi]] was ruled as part of the state known as [[Totky]] by the Totyq Cenukkiq, whom there were now two of.

Laxoxal was the last king who claimed the title of king of Taspi. Hailed as a hero of the [[Totky-Feculky wars#First Totky-Feculky War |Totky-Feculky War]], he attained influence in Taspi and Feculky greater than that lost by his direct predecessors. After decades of rule and advancements in his personal power, Laxoxal waged war against the two [[Tot#Tot Cenukki|Totyq Cenukkiq]], whom he considered usurpers of powers originally belonging to the king. The war ended in disaster for him, partially due to the opportunistic [[Totky-Feculky wars#Feculky uprising|Feculky uprising]] against him. Laxoxal died in unclear and mythologized circumstances after being taken prisoner by the short-lived [[Feculky]] theocracy, and with him died his lineage and the entire monarchy.
