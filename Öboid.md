**Öboids** are a subspecies of humans indigenous to various locations on [[Winter]], such as the [[Mivēra]] of [[Iccous ru īsaur]] and various peoples in northern [[Fountainhead]], most notably the [[Öb]] peoples of [[T'ugü]], from which the term *öboid* is derived.
# Anatomy
Öboids are anatomically considered a subgroup of humans rather than a separate group, but bear several superficial differences which set them apart from other human groups. The most notable characteristics of öboid anatomy are:
- **Reduced stature** — The average height of male and female adult öboids is around 1.2m and 1.3m respectively, which the tallest öboid groups standing at around 1.4-1.5m.
- **Limb length** — The legs are slightly shorter and arms slightly longer than the average human.
- **Hand and foot structure** — The hands and feet are long and slim and more symmetrical in structure. The little finger of the hand is positioned towards the base of the palm and is fully opposable, like a second thumb, while the actual thumb is smaller in size. The toes are long and somewhat more dextrous than usual, which varying degrees of opposability of the big toe.

Öboids also tend to exhibit more anatomical variation and adaptation to their environments than other human groups, perhaps due to long parallel histories of separation and isolation from the rest of humanity. For example, the öboids of northern [[Fountainhead]] have almost no body hair, while the [[Mivēra]] have coarse, dense hair covering almost their entire bodies, barring the ears, nose, forehead, palms, soles of the feet, and the area around the eyes. The [[Mivēra]] also have some differences in tooth and jaw structure.
